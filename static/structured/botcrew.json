There's very little to talk about in the way of shuttle or event work, but her gauntlet prowess helps make her among the best daily use crew in the game. A #1 ranked DIP/MED pair (by a big margin) in combination with two hefty single rolls has given her preeminent status in the gauntlet since her introduction two years ago. And as you may hear from unhappy gauntlet-goers, she even has a trait set all to herself; El-Aurian, Marksman, and Communicator combine to put her head and shoulders above everyone else for 48 hour at a time. \r\n\r\nThere is a sense of waning power with the proliferation (and buffing) of DIP monster Locutus and even a mega event Minuet that nearly matches her DIP and can catch her napping. But unless you're overstocked with the best that the gauntlet has to offer, Guinan remains a great choice for professional coin flipping.

If you've missed out on the run of ENG/SEC crew up to this point, he's still a great add with strong daily use potential, but if you've already snagged a couple, Tuvok doesn't really bring enough else to the table to make him a must-add."},{"name":"Major Kira","short_name":"Kira","traits_named":["Bajoran","Veteran","Resourceful"],"traits_hidden":["nonhuman","female","organic","ds9","kira","crew_max_rarity_2"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_kirashorthair_sm.png","collections":["Valor in Combat","Uncommon Crew"],"totalChronCost":2091,"factionOnlyTotal":50,"craftCost":77700,"symbol":"kira_major_shorthair_crew","max_rarity":2,"bigbook_tier":"7","events":"0","ranks":{"voyRank":733,"gauntletRank":718,"chronCostRank":699,"B_CMD":426,"A_CMD":430,"B_SEC":396,"A_SEC":401,"V_CMD_SCI":695,"G_CMD_SCI":592,"V_CMD_SEC":579,"G_CMD_SEC":403,"V_CMD_ENG":689,"G_CMD_ENG":548,"V_CMD_DIP":700,"G_CMD_DIP":594,"V_CMD_MED":679,"G_CMD_MED":506,"V_SCI_SEC":667,"G_SCI_SEC":512,"V_SCI_ENG":753,"V_SCI_DIP":757,"V_SCI_MED":754,"V_SEC_ENG":655,"G_SEC_ENG":459,"V_SEC_DIP":680,"G_SEC_DIP":569,"V_SEC_MED":644,"G_SEC_MED":431,"V_ENG_DIP":759,"V_ENG_MED":757,"V_DIP_MED":758},"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":304,"range_min":60,"range_max":176},"command_skill":{"core":273,"range_min":37,"range_max":126}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"security_skill":{"core":258,"range_min":60,"range_max":176},"command_skill":{"core":215,"range_min":37,"range_max":126}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"A very average CMD card which might find some use helping out Sito, Seska and Dax in weekday challenges but nothing amazing about the card.

Let's get the zeroes out of the way first, because there are plenty of those. Not offering much (read: anything) for the arena, gauntlet, collections, events, or traits, he's more of a daily shuttle and voyage contributor. The value of a big base [_which is not among the more useful skills_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycUq3J1E4xr1z4Pe6BfT56-M1SBaEYtWsl-O4oPwxlk/edit#bookmark=id.nqn5lerzhcsq), nor has a realistic chance to ever catch a bonus (costumed mega confirmed) is dubious. But if you somehow have a fused Rabbit from its weekday 6-pack and no mega event Ru'afo, then you're in a pretty unique situation and he may leverage his ENG into some weekend help. By the numbers it's still strong, even if we'd like to see it attached to a more common event character or a bevy of traits.\r\n\r\nThe majority of his value to your roster will come on voyages. Rabbit is one of two legendaries in the game (Imprinted Archer being the other) to have ENG and MED as its top two skills, which means that  [_for that voyage combo_](https://i.imgur.com/bYSjYzd.png), at least, he has a hind leg up on the competition. For the accompanying SCI/MED and ENG/SCI runs, he's going to contribute a tertiary skill that's often lacking in those crew. In short, his skill set and particularly skill order is great and will serve to inflate his voyage value. Rabbit's holes are certainly substantial, but you'll still see plenty of daily use from him even if he's lacking elsewhere."},{"name":"Vengeful L'Rell","short_name":"L'Rell","traits_named":["Klingon","Brutal","Villain","Interrogator"],"traits_hidden":["nonhuman","female","dsc","lrell","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_lrell_sm.png","collections":[],"totalChronCost":5702,"factionOnlyTotal":40,"craftCost":780950,"symbol":"dsc_lrell_mekleth_crew","max_rarity":5,"bigbook_tier":"7","events":"24","ranks":{"voyRank":309,"gauntletRank":502,"chronCostRank":235,"B_SEC":58,"A_SEC":84,"B_DIP":53,"A_DIP":73,"V_CMD_SCI":612,"V_CMD_SEC":295,"G_CMD_SEC":431,"V_CMD_ENG":601,"V_CMD_DIP":248,"G_CMD_DIP":310,"V_CMD_MED":567,"V_SCI_SEC":237,"G_SCI_SEC":372,"V_SCI_ENG":498,"V_SCI_DIP":192,"G_SCI_DIP":219,"V_SCI_MED":478,"V_SEC_ENG":220,"G_SEC_ENG":345,"V_SEC_DIP":34,"G_SEC_DIP":100,"V_SEC_MED":174,"G_SEC_MED":315,"V_ENG_DIP":164,"G_ENG_DIP":185,"V_ENG_MED":469,"V_DIP_MED":148,"G_DIP_MED":185},"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":1118,"range_min":190,"range_max":380},"security_skill":{"core":1047,"range_min":132,"range_max":230}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":728,"range_min":190,"range_max":380},"security_skill":{"core":599,"range_min":132,"range_max":230}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":754,"range_min":190,"range_max":380},"security_skill":{"core":644,"range_min":132,"range_max":230}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":832,"range_min":190,"range_max":380},"security_skill":{"core":739,"range_min":132,"range_max":230}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":968,"range_min":190,"range_max":380},"security_skill":{"core":878,"range_min":132,"range_max":230}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"Traits (including Disco) have pushed L'Rell well into double digit bonuses within a relatively short time which has given two 1k bases several chances to shine.

There are several talking points here, but let's start with Seven's pristine skill order where she has no peer at any rarity. In combination with a strong stat total (and voyage MED), she's among the most impactful voyagers in the game whose value above replacement blows past CMD/SEC also-rans with similar overall numbers.\r\n\r\nEqually as mouth-watering is event eligibility to rival the fabled Zhian'tara Odo. Triggering bonuses for Doc, Seven, and Borg events, the trait and variant mish mash has given her a minimum of four events in each of the last three years.

Coupled with easily the best MED of the bunch and #2 SCI, she's guaranteed to add big, fat success numbers to Faction shuttles that will fail at 99% anyways.\r\n\r\nWe'll take the downsides (gauntlet, arena) in stride, as her power/usefulness combo in other areas is simply outstanding.

For the crit boosting fans out there, Troi's ship ability has you covered, though the attack boost that comes along with it is pretty paltry and a tad slow, but all that is just icing on the cake for a card that is as rock-solid as they come."},{"name":"Xindi Insectoid Councilor","short_name":"Insectoid","traits_named":["Xindi","Brutal","Diplomat","Desperate"],"traits_hidden":["nonhuman","organic","ent","insectoid","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_xindi_insectoid_sm.png","collections":["New Life and New Civilizations","Delphic Expanse"],"totalChronCost":5058,"factionOnlyTotal":77,"craftCost":724250,"symbol":"xindi_insectoid_counselor_crew","max_rarity":5,"bigbook_tier":"3","events":"3","ranks":{"voyRank":11,"gauntletRank":424,"chronCostRank":162,"B_SCI":22,"A_SCI":52,"B_SEC":261,"A_SEC":264,"B_DIP":19,"A_DIP":46,"V_CMD_SCI":115,"G_CMD_SCI":550,"V_CMD_SEC":344,"G_CMD_SEC":437,"V_CMD_ENG":500,"V_CMD_DIP":146,"G_CMD_DIP":352,"V_CMD_MED":453,"V_SCI_SEC":29,"G_SCI_SEC":207,"V_SCI_ENG":105,"G_SCI_ENG":331,"V_SCI_DIP":5,"G_SCI_DIP":132,"V_SCI_MED":71,"G_SCI_MED":306,"V_SEC_ENG":255,"G_SEC_ENG":363,"V_SEC_DIP":45,"G_SEC_DIP":134,"V_SEC_MED":197,"G_SEC_MED":331,"V_ENG_DIP":58,"G_ENG_DIP":248,"V_ENG_MED":284,"V_DIP_MED":48,"G_DIP_MED":226},"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":1252,"range_min":162,"range_max":332},"science_skill":{"core":1169,"range_min":64,"range_max":147},"security_skill":{"core":541,"range_min":111,"range_max":235}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":862,"range_min":162,"range_max":332},"science_skill":{"core":741,"range_min":64,"range_max":147},"security_skill":{"core":316,"range_min":111,"range_max":235}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":888,"range_min":162,"range_max":332},"science_skill":{"core":785,"range_min":64,"range_max":147},"security_skill":{"core":340,"range_min":111,"range_max":235}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":966,"range_min":162,"range_max":332},"science_skill":{"core":875,"range_min":64,"range_max":147},"security_skill":{"core":385,"range_min":111,"range_max":235}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":1102,"range_min":162,"range_max":332},"science_skill":{"core":1007,"range_min":64,"range_max":147},"security_skill":{"core":482,"range_min":111,"range_max":235}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"See Sisko, Prophet Sarah.

She's one of just three ENG/DIP voyagers ranked between 20th and 160th, the only crew with her particular skill order, and her voyage ENG is a robust [_number two_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB8-LXFaed4), even if, as previously noted, ENG is in the midst of a big time facelift. \r\n\r\nPo checks the requisite boxes for new crew - top ten base, voyage rank 20-40 - and even contributes double collections, so if you loved her role as Tilly's eccentric bud and super genius, you're okay to foray into the weekday 6-pack to snag her. Just beware that six months from now she could end up as double mega event powerhouse, pedestrian voyager #65, or anywhere in between.\r\n\r\n[_I did it!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIQJpWYywZU)  I got through this without a Teletubbies reference."},{"name":"1701 Sisko","short_name":"Sisko","traits_named":["Human","Federation","Starfleet","Bajoran","Cultural Figure","Inspiring","Undercover Operative","Chef"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","ds9","captain","bridge_crew","sisko","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_siskotos_sm.png","collections":["To Boldly Go"],"totalChronCost":4950,"factionOnlyTotal":34,"craftCost":818700,"symbol":"sisko_tos_crew","max_rarity":5,"bigbook_tier":"8","events":"13","ranks":{"voyRank":219,"gauntletRank":286,"chronCostRank":428,"B_CMD":96,"A_CMD":63,"B_SEC":68,"A_SEC":129,"B_DIP":287,"A_DIP":301,"V_CMD_SCI":131,"G_CMD_SCI":80,"V_CMD_SEC":52,"G_CMD_SEC":100,"V_CMD_ENG":115,"G_CMD_ENG":63,"V_CMD_DIP":90,"G_CMD_DIP":80,"V_CMD_MED":87,"G_CMD_MED":55,"V_SCI_SEC":217,"G_SCI_SEC":549,"V_SCI_ENG":431,"V_SCI_DIP":360,"G_SCI_DIP":488,"V_SCI_MED":408,"V_SEC_ENG":199,"G_SEC_ENG":489,"V_SEC_DIP":108,"G_SEC_DIP":371,"V_SEC_MED":163,"G_SEC_MED":463,"V_ENG_DIP":341,"G_ENG_DIP":466,"V_ENG_MED":394,"V_DIP_MED":286,"G_DIP_MED":398},"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":957,"range_min":243,"range_max":539},"security_skill":{"core":1031,"range_min":64,"range_max":139},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":513,"range_min":87,"range_max":173}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":605,"range_min":243,"range_max":539},"security_skill":{"core":603,"range_min":64,"range_max":139},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":288,"range_min":87,"range_max":173}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":620,"range_min":243,"range_max":539},"security_skill":{"core":647,"range_min":64,"range_max":139},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":312,"range_min":87,"range_max":173}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":707,"range_min":243,"range_max":539},"security_skill":{"core":737,"range_min":64,"range_max":139},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":357,"range_min":87,"range_max":173}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":831,"range_min":243,"range_max":539},"security_skill":{"core":869,"range_min":64,"range_max":139},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":454,"range_min":87,"range_max":173}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"This anachronistic Sisko's primary flip-flops from base to voyages, but neither is particularly effective.

As the top voyager in the SEC/ENG/SCI set, Nomad is a plug-and-play crew for anyone chasing their childhood memories and though a crew's usability often slips more rapidly without regular events or broader utility, Nomad is in line [_to serve man_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dk01eeKMD_I) for at least a while."},{"name":"Mirror 'Smiley' O'Brien","short_name":"O'Brien","traits_named":["Human","Resourceful","Jury Rigger","Terran Rebellion","Mirror Universe"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","ds9","mirror","captain","obrien","crew_max_rarity_3"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_obriensmiley_sm.png","collections":["Spit and Bailing Wire","Rare Crew"],"totalChronCost":2987,"factionOnlyTotal":40,"craftCost":229700,"symbol":"obrien_mirror_crew","max_rarity":3,"bigbook_tier":"2","events":"0","ranks":{"voyRank":649,"gauntletRank":728,"chronCostRank":667,"B_CMD":362,"A_CMD":410,"B_SEC":435,"A_SEC":436,"B_ENG":150,"A_ENG":174,"V_CMD_SCI":621,"G_CMD_SCI":625,"V_CMD_SEC":557,"G_CMD_SEC":537,"V_CMD_ENG":400,"G_CMD_ENG":486,"V_CMD_DIP":633,"G_CMD_DIP":630,"V_CMD_MED":577,"G_CMD_MED":538,"V_SCI_SEC":675,"G_SCI_SEC":619,"V_SCI_ENG":432,"G_SCI_ENG":394,"V_SCI_DIP":734,"V_SCI_MED":704,"V_SEC_ENG":449,"G_SEC_ENG":448,"V_SEC_DIP":687,"G_SEC_DIP":645,"V_SEC_MED":654,"G_SEC_MED":517,"V_ENG_DIP":558,"G_ENG_DIP":582,"V_ENG_MED":395,"G_ENG_MED":328,"V_DIP_MED":717},"base_skills":{"engineering_skill":{"core":545,"range_min":30,"range_max":102},"command_skill":{"core":373,"range_min":37,"range_max":77},"security_skill":{"core":180,"range_min":30,"range_max":84}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"engineering_skill":{"core":430,"range_min":30,"range_max":102},"command_skill":{"core":252,"range_min":37,"range_max":77},"security_skill":{"core":119,"range_min":30,"range_max":84}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"engineering_skill":{"core":466,"range_min":30,"range_max":102},"command_skill":{"core":302,"range_min":37,"range_max":77},"security_skill":{"core":148,"range_min":30,"range_max":84}}}],"in_portal":false,"markdownContent":"In somewhat of a rare move from DB we have a main cast card that actually can keep up with all the ensigns!

As a card, he's just fantastic and incredibly useful day to day. On voyages he has a delicious skill set which is weighted to put him on the right part of the ENG/MED curve and in conjunction with a great overall score is unlikely to be completely displaced from those voyages within Timelines' lifetime. Even more impressive than guaranteed voyage job security (which is hard to do) is Caretaker's gauntlet résumé.\r\n\r\n[_His #1 ENG isn't just good, it's stupid good_](https://i.imgur.com/FNPxIGY.png). Yes, those names below him are a 1-skill crew and a super rare. And somehow even more magnificent is his ownership of six (!!!) ranked gauntlet pairs including two #1s, mostly on the back of his monster ENG roll. The gap between him and the #2 ENG/MED gauntleteer is almost 300 points; larger than any other skill pairing. I'll cut the accolades short, but suffice it to say, he's a monster. His biggest (only) weakness is rarely exceeding 25% crit, but with such a huge lead over the competition, your best option against him is usually 50 merits.\r\n\r\nSo what do we do with  [~~_a drunken sailor_~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGyPuey-1Jw)  our copies of Banjo Man? There's no clear-cut answer. It's certainly tempting to want to feed him citations for his prodigious voyage potential. If you did that before the changes to gauntlet rewards (✋guilty) and land another copy, do you keep him? His voyage offering is still unique enough that you shouldn't feel bad for doing so if you have space and you can always fly the double Caretaker formation in gauntlet. But if you haven't cited him yet, you're getting 50% or more of his benefit with just that first star.

He's the first (but not last) Q continuum crew with the MED skill and will monopolize their events' shuttles as well as former MED megas for non-bonus (or Costumed) situations without crowding them out of voyages. He's a row of zeroes elsewhere, but big base power, an average event clip, and great voyage compliment makes it worth paying for his last star on any roster."},{"name":"Captain Silva La Forge","short_name":"Silva","traits_named":["Human","Federation","Starfleet","Explorer","Tactician"],"traits_hidden":["female","organic","tng","silva","captain","bridge_crew","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_silva_captain_sm.png","collections":[],"totalChronCost":5263,"factionOnlyTotal":57,"craftCost":766250,"symbol":"silva_captain_crew","max_rarity":5,"bigbook_tier":"10","events":"2","ranks":{"voyRank":146,"gauntletRank":110,"chronCostRank":218,"B_CMD":48,"A_CMD":29,"B_SEC":331,"A_SEC":304,"B_DIP":78,"A_DIP":129,"V_CMD_SCI":89,"G_CMD_SCI":57,"V_CMD_SEC":73,"G_CMD_SEC":26,"V_CMD_ENG":76,"G_CMD_ENG":42,"V_CMD_DIP":19,"G_CMD_DIP":61,"V_CMD_MED":45,"G_CMD_MED":38,"V_SCI_SEC":337,"G_SCI_SEC":283,"V_SCI_ENG":395,"V_SCI_DIP":216,"G_SCI_DIP":517,"V_SCI_MED":373,"V_SEC_ENG":305,"G_SEC_ENG":263,"V_SEC_DIP":102,"G_SEC_DIP":218,"V_SEC_MED":257,"G_SEC_MED":232,"V_ENG_DIP":192,"G_ENG_DIP":500,"V_ENG_MED":350,"V_DIP_MED":170,"G_DIP_MED":425},"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":1059,"range_min":259,"range_max":606},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":1026,"range_min":68,"range_max":156},"security_skill":{"core":408,"range_min":149,"range_max":309}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":669,"range_min":259,"range_max":606},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":578,"range_min":68,"range_max":156},"security_skill":{"core":183,"range_min":149,"range_max":309}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":695,"range_min":259,"range_max":606},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":623,"range_min":68,"range_max":156},"security_skill":{"core":207,"range_min":149,"range_max":309}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":773,"range_min":259,"range_max":606},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":718,"range_min":68,"range_max":156},"security_skill":{"core":252,"range_min":149,"range_max":309}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":909,"range_min":259,"range_max":606},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":857,"range_min":68,"range_max":156},"security_skill":{"core":349,"range_min":149,"range_max":309}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"Have you ever seen those composite photos where they blur a hundred different faces together and the result is vaguely attractive, but completely generic?

Picard is featured is quite a lot of events but this versions stats are nowhere near competitive. A side note is that he is the #1 common Voyager, so he might make it on one of your first two hour voyages.

Let's start at the collections tab, where he's nearly peerless. An early 2019 server push pushed Locutus into rarefied air as one of three crew to appear in three stat-boosting collections, none of which are particularly easy to complete. The raw voyage numbers are great, and while a DIP/SEC set may not seem impressive, he's one of only three such crew in the top 50 voyagers. His wheelhouse remains the gauntlet where only he and The Caretaker own two #1 ranked skill pairings (four overall). A massive DIP proficiency is the best single roll in the game and often boosted by a half dozen frequently seen crit traits. His unique arena ability (1 second attack) can allow some skirmish shenanigans with fast-activating damage crew and shave a lot of time off your weekends.\r\n   \r\nThe elephant in the room is clearly a set of poor bases. Though not at Gowron levels of disgusting, they're bad enough to be considered a solid super rare, even at 5/5. His opportunities are fairly frequent thanks to Picard and Borg weekends (#2 Borg DIP), but he'll perform noticeably behind the top ranked crew and has more variant competition than any other character. Thanks to his uniqueness in several areas including collections and the arena, he's arguably the most well-rounded crew in the game."},{"name":"Enterprise-E Picard","short_name":"Picard","traits_named":["Federation","Starfleet","Human","Inspiring","Astrophysicist","Exoarchaeology","Musician","Tactician"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","tng","captain","bridge_crew","picard","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_picardfirstcontact_sm.png","collections":["To Boldly Go"],"totalChronCost":5399,"factionOnlyTotal":52,"craftCost":911950,"symbol":"picard_firstcontact_crew","max_rarity":5,"bigbook_tier":"9","events":"12","ranks":{"voyRank":229,"gauntletRank":85,"chronCostRank":224,"B_CMD":145,"A_CMD":132,"B_SEC":309,"A_SEC":328,"B_DIP":94,"A_DIP":82,"V_CMD_SCI":202,"G_CMD_SCI":199,"V_CMD_SEC":126,"G_CMD_SEC":154,"V_CMD_ENG":192,"G_CMD_ENG":159,"V_CMD_DIP":34,"G_CMD_DIP":19,"V_CMD_MED":153,"G_CMD_MED":148,"V_SCI_SEC":381,"G_SCI_SEC":482,"V_SCI_ENG":435,"V_SCI_DIP":150,"G_SCI_DIP":100,"V_SCI_MED":413,"V_SEC_ENG":339,"G_SEC_ENG":433,"V_SEC_DIP":83,"G_SEC_DIP":62,"V_SEC_MED":294,"G_SEC_MED":409,"V_ENG_DIP":121,"G_ENG_DIP":69,"V_ENG_MED":401,"V_DIP_MED":116,"G_DIP_MED":86},"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":982,"range_min":240,"range_max":538},"command_skill":{"core":852,"range_min":192,"range_max":389},"security_skill":{"core":449,"range_min":72,"range_max":194}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":592,"range_min":240,"range_max":538},"command_skill":{"core":404,"range_min":192,"range_max":389},"security_skill":{"core":224,"range_min":72,"range_max":194}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":618,"range_min":240,"range_max":538},"command_skill":{"core":449,"range_min":192,"range_max":389},"security_skill":{"core":248,"range_min":72,"range_max":194}}},{"rarity":3,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":696,"range_min":240,"range_max":538},"command_skill":{"core":544,"range_min":192,"range_max":389},"security_skill":{"core":293,"range_min":72,"range_max":194}}},{"rarity":4,"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":832,"range_min":240,"range_max":538},"command_skill":{"core":683,"range_min":192,"range_max":389},"security_skill":{"core":390,"range_min":72,"range_max":194}}}],"in_portal":true,"markdownContent":"When your character has almost twenty variants, a few duds are expected.

His SEC rank is certainly shiny and even though it's in the same neighborhood as the popular Rura Penthe variant, is still undeniable on every day of the week. His other bases are enhancement tools; a low CMD secondary helps give him a top five 'SEC and CMD' score for that extremely common shuttle seat and his ENG makes him the second variant behind Survivalist Kirk to offer that skill for event flexibility.\r\n\r\nKirk's also an interesting niche choice on ships thanks to a 30% attack speed boost that only a small number of crew offer in that amount.

You may not need more of his skill set, but since he performs for voyages like a 3/5 legendary would, here's your chance to replace and freeze another super rare if you're still using them in that part of the game."},{"name":"Dr. Reyga","short_name":"Reyga","traits_named":["Ferengi","Astrophysicist","Innovator","Maverick"],"traits_hidden":["nonhuman","male","organic","tng","reyga","crew_max_rarity_3"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_reyga_sm.png","collections":["Rules Of Acquisition","The Daystrom Award","Rare Crew"],"totalChronCost":2736,"factionOnlyTotal":24,"craftCost":128500,"symbol":"reyga_crew","max_rarity":3,"bigbook_tier":"4","events":"0","ranks":{"voyRank":701,"gauntletRank":732,"chronCostRank":709,"B_SCI":188,"A_SCI":212,"B_DIP":407,"A_DIP":424,"V_CMD_SCI":598,"G_CMD_SCI":567,"V_CMD_SEC":751,"V_CMD_ENG":754,"V_CMD_DIP":670,"G_CMD_DIP":595,"V_CMD_MED":748,"V_SCI_SEC":587,"G_SCI_SEC":559,"V_SCI_ENG":465,"G_SCI_ENG":349,"V_SCI_DIP":473,"G_SCI_DIP":407,"V_SCI_MED":449,"G_SCI_MED":324,"V_SEC_ENG":749,"V_SEC_DIP":675,"G_SEC_DIP":622,"V_SEC_MED":745,"V_ENG_DIP":646,"G_ENG_DIP":555,"V_ENG_MED":739,"V_DIP_MED":611,"G_DIP_MED":472},"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":512,"range_min":39,"range_max":149},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":300,"range_min":34,"range_max":130}},"skill_data":[{"rarity":1,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":397,"range_min":39,"range_max":149},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":179,"range_min":34,"range_max":130}}},{"rarity":2,"base_skills":{"science_skill":{"core":433,"range_min":39,"range_max":149},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":229,"range_min":34,"range_max":130}}}],"in_portal":false,"markdownContent":"Strong SCI crew are quite common in the rare leagues but this Ferengi makes a worthy contender. #2 SCI base is a strong start and will certainly do well in the Sunday cadet missions.

If you've missed out on the ubiquitous Surak or Locutus, Boothby is a fair re-creation. His three ranked pairs include a #2 SCI/DIP which edges out Surak by a small margin and can easily two-for-one new gauntlet exclusive Armus - the blob who also toppled Surak from the SCI/CMD catbird seat. Poor traits means he's not an auto-include, but is still serviceable as your rotational fifth (or fouth).\r\n\r\nIn short, Boothby's skill set makes him a great choice to break up SCI-centric walls in the gauntlet and, in combination with a huge stat total, makes him one of the best voyagers in the game. There are definite holes to Boothby's game - a lack of event work and unexciting arena prospects - and relative to the strength of newer cards, his bases are merely ok.
