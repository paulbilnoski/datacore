But [_did you know that_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSJAwndDTds) she's great for voyages too? Seeing any kind of MED near the top of the voyage ranks was a rarity for a long time and despite DB recently opening things up a little more, she's still holding strong as a top DIP/MED option. There's very little to talk about in the way of shuttle or event work, but her gauntlet prowess helps make her among the best daily use crew in the game. A #1 ranked DIP/MED pair (by a big margin) in combination with two hefty single rolls has given her preeminent status in the gauntlet since her introduction two years ago. And as you may hear from unhappy gauntlet-goers, she even has a trait set all to herself; El-Aurian, Marksman, and Communicator combine to put her head and shoulders above everyone else for 48 hour at a time. \r\n\r\nThere is a sense of waning power with the proliferation (and buffing) of DIP monster Locutus and even a mega event Minuet that nearly matches her DIP and can catch her napping. But unless you're overstocked with the best that the gauntlet has to offer, Guinan remains a great choice for professional coin flipping.

As a card, he's just fantastic and incredibly useful day to day. On voyages he has a delicious skill set which is weighted to put him on the right part of the ENG/MED curve and in conjunction with a great overall score is unlikely to be completely displaced from those voyages within Timelines' lifetime. Even more impressive than guaranteed voyage job security (which is hard to do) is Caretaker's gauntlet résumé.\r\n\r\n[_His #1 ENG isn't just good, it's stupid good_](https://i.imgur.com/FNPxIGY.png). Yes, those names below him are a 1-skill crew and a super rare. And somehow even more magnificent is his ownership of six (!!!) ranked gauntlet pairs including two #1s, mostly on the back of his monster ENG roll. The gap between him and the #2 ENG/MED gauntleteer is almost 300 points; larger than any other skill pairing. I'll cut the accolades short, but suffice it to say, he's a monster. His biggest (only) weakness is rarely exceeding 25% crit, but with such a huge lead over the competition, your best option against him is usually 50 merits.\r\n\r\nSo what do we do with  [~~_a drunken sailor_~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGyPuey-1Jw)  our copies of Banjo Man? There's no clear-cut answer. It's certainly tempting to want to feed him citations for his prodigious voyage potential. If you did that before the changes to gauntlet rewards (✋guilty) and land another copy, do you keep him? His voyage offering is still unique enough that you shouldn't feel bad for doing so if you have space and you can always fly the double Caretaker formation in gauntlet.

Let's start at the collections tab, where he's nearly peerless. An early 2019 server push pushed Locutus into rarefied air as one of three crew to appear in three stat-boosting collections, none of which are particularly easy to complete. The raw voyage numbers are great, and while a DIP/SEC set may not seem impressive, he's one of only three such crew in the top 50 voyagers. His wheelhouse remains the gauntlet where only he and The Caretaker own two #1 ranked skill pairings (four overall). A massive DIP proficiency is the best single roll in the game and often boosted by a half dozen frequently seen crit traits. His unique arena ability (1 second attack) can allow some skirmish shenanigans with fast-activating damage crew and shave a lot of time off your weekends.\r\n   \r\nThe elephant in the room is clearly a set of poor bases. Though not at Gowron levels of disgusting, they're bad enough to be considered a solid super rare, even at 5/5. His opportunities are fairly frequent thanks to Picard and Borg weekends (#2 Borg DIP), but he'll perform noticeably behind the top ranked crew and has more variant competition than any other character. Thanks to his uniqueness in several areas including collections and the arena, he's taken the mantle from La Borg as the most well-rounded crew in the game."},{"name":"Enterprise-E Picard","short_name":"Picard","traits_named":["Federation","Starfleet","Human","Inspiring","Astrophysicist","Exoarchaeology","Musician","Tactician"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","tng","captain","bridge_crew","picard","crew_max_rarity_5"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_picardfirstcontact_sm.png","collections":["To Boldly Go"],"totalChronCost":5054,"factionOnlyTotal":68,"craftCost":917750,"symbol":"picard_firstcontact_crew","max_rarity":5,"bigbook_tier":"13","events":"12","ranks":{"voyRank":211,"gauntletRank":83,"chronCostRank":189,"B_CMD":134,"B_SEC":296,"B_DIP":91,"V_CMD_SCI":186,"G_CMD_SCI":188,"V_CMD_SEC":120,"G_CMD_SEC":150,"V_CMD_ENG":180,"G_CMD_ENG":149,"V_CMD_DIP":33,"G_CMD_DIP":19,"V_CMD_MED":140,"G_CMD_MED":144,"V_SCI_SEC":359,"G_SCI_SEC":459,"V_SCI_ENG":410,"V_SCI_DIP":140,"G_SCI_DIP":96,"V_SCI_MED":388,"V_SEC_ENG":323,"G_SEC_ENG":419,"V_SEC_DIP":79,"G_SEC_DIP":63,"V_SEC_MED":279,"G_SEC_MED":392,"V_ENG_DIP":118,"G_ENG_DIP":68,"V_ENG_MED":382,"V_DIP_MED":110,"G_DIP_MED":85},"base_skills":{"diplomacy_skill":{"core":982,"range_min":240,"range_max":538},"command_skill":{"core":852,"range_min":192,"range_max":389},"security_skill":{"core":449,"range_min":72,"range_max":194}},"markdownContent":"When your character has almost twenty variants, a few duds are expected.

We'll still gladly snatch up his great base/event count pairing, but he may not have as many chances for a big bonus impact as other Faction heroes.

In the gauntlet, your 45% crit Kirk is going to face fewer 5% Sevens of Nine and more mirror matchups. For Kirk events, an 879 SCI lead over the top non-bonus option has dipped to 780 over a 1/5 Survivalist and, as your competitors star him up, brings him closer to Mega crew territory where you're trying to pull even, rather than exploit an edge. His skill set remains strong for voyages with little competition above him, but sinking relative power there and poor bases make this global gift a bit less sweet for those who already owned him."},{"name":"Incognito Kirk","short_name":"Kirk","traits_named":["Human","Federation","Starfleet","Inspiring","Undercover Operative","Investigator"],"traits_hidden":["male","organic","tos","captain","bridge_crew","kirk","crew_max_rarity_4"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_kirk_incognito_sm.png","collections":["To Boldly Go"],"totalChronCost":5320,"factionOnlyTotal":49,"craftCost":670900,"symbol":"kirk_incognito_crew","max_rarity":4,"bigbook_tier":"4","events":"12","ranks":{"voyRank":382,"gauntletRank":526,"chronCostRank":230,"B_CMD":137,"B_SEC":206,"B_DIP":363,"V_CMD_SCI":290,"G_CMD_SCI":402,"V_CMD_SEC":148,"G_CMD_SEC":221,"V_CMD_ENG":263,"G_CMD_ENG":379,"V_CMD_DIP":267,"G_CMD_DIP":356,"V_CMD_MED":222,"G_CMD_MED":335,"V_SCI_SEC":376,"G_SCI_SEC":361,"V_SCI_ENG":522,"V_SCI_DIP":487,"G_SCI_DIP":558,"V_SCI_MED":510,"V_SEC_ENG":340,"G_SEC_ENG":338,"V_SEC_DIP":309,"G_SEC_DIP":337,"V_SEC_MED":299,"G_SEC_MED":308,"V_ENG_DIP":486,"G_ENG_DIP":551,"V_ENG_MED":507,"V_DIP_MED":408,"G_DIP_MED":460},"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":847,"range_min":104,"range_max":224},"security_skill":{"core":622,"range_min":114,"range_max":245},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":358,"range_min":46,"range_max":100}},"markdownContent":"With the best bases of the 4* Kirks, you'd think there would be more to recommend this handsome chap, but with a vanilla skill set, a merely serviceable ship ability and traits that don't go very far, he seems appropriately inconspicuous.

The newer your account, the more use you'll get from finishing him, but in a vacuum he's not a special crew by any metric nor one worthy of honor. His pie-in-the-sky Cardassian mega month and fairly exclusive Investigator/SEC node unlock are perks worth looking forward to, even if an otherwise average crew doesn't move the needle for you.\r\n\r\nWhat a difference a few hundred points can make and a good reminder that most crew are dealing in a percentage points difference.

Let's start at the top where Kirk's #1 voyage SEC by a healthy margin helps him claim a strong voyage score in a common, but not _too_ common skill set. If you're one to deep dive your voyage planning, he's the top voyager for his skill order and one of only two in the top 100. \r\n\r\nHe's also a no-brainer on the weekend where his overall lead for variant events (14) meets some future trait mega possibilities. His SEC rank is certainly shiny and even though it's in the same neighborhood as the popular Rura Penthe variant, is still undeniable on every day of the week. His other bases are enhancement tools; a low CMD secondary helps give him a top five 'SEC and CMD' score for that extremely common shuttle seat and his ENG makes him the second variant behind Survivalist Kirk to offer that skill for event flexibility.\r\n\r\nKirk's also an interesting niche choice on ships thanks to a 30% attack speed boost that only a small number of crew offer in that amount. It activates 40% faster than any of the others, but only lasts a short time - hopefully long enough to chase your rivals  [_'round the moons of Nibia_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsYT8YHL-R0).

All things considered, he's one of the lesser ENG/MED crew, but will still be a handy card to have around."},{"name":"Young T'Pau","short_name":"T'Pau","traits_named":["Vulcan","Spiritual","Telepath","Syrrannite"],"traits_hidden":["nonhuman","female","organic","ent","tpau","crew_max_rarity_4"],"imageUrlPortrait":"crew_portraits_cm_tpau_young_sm.png","collections":["Live Long and Prosper"],"totalChronCost":5176,"factionOnlyTotal":30,"craftCost":570400,"symbol":"tpau_young_crew","max_rarity":4,"bigbook_tier":"4","events":"9","ranks":{"voyRank":330,"gauntletRank":559,"chronCostRank":362,"B_CMD":120,"B_SCI":127,"B_DIP":324,"V_CMD_SCI":54,"G_CMD_SCI":93,"V_CMD_SEC":325,"G_CMD_SEC":365,"V_CMD_ENG":232,"G_CMD_ENG":269,"V_CMD_DIP":211,"G_CMD_DIP":367,"V_CMD_MED":191,"G_CMD_MED":251,"V_SCI_SEC":350,"G_SCI_SEC":413,"V_SCI_ENG":235,"G_SCI_ENG":263,"V_SCI_DIP":235,"G_SCI_DIP":407,"V_SCI_MED":198,"G_SCI_MED":239,"V_SEC_ENG":583,"V_SEC_DIP":519,"G_SEC_DIP":644,"V_SEC_MED":572,"V_ENG_DIP":465,"G_ENG_DIP":606,"V_ENG_MED":481,"V_DIP_MED":386,"G_DIP_MED":505},"base_skills":{"command_skill":{"core":888,"range_min":91,"range_max":344},"science_skill":{"core":682,"range_min":74,"range_max":233},"diplomacy_skill":{"core":426,"range_min":7,"range_max":21}},"markdownContent":"She's not the classic T'Pau we need, but because of ongoing rights issues, she's the T'Pau we deserve right now. The Raider of the Lost Kir'Shara makes up for any disappointment with a strong CMD base and CMD/SCI voyage total, and has a couple of event-catching traits up her sleeves that could help her find occasional weekend work. With position ships like the Shenzhou now available in Dabo, abilities like T'Pau's +10 damage at 8 seconds become more usable and can make her a strong Arena/Skirmish piece in certain combos."}]
