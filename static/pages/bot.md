## DataCore bot

As a companion to this website, I'm hosting a Discord bot which uses the same data. It can give you quick stats about crew, places to farm items as well as help with beholds - using the magic of AI / computer vision to extract the options out of behold screenshots. The bot is available on the (unofficial) [Star Trek Timelines Discord server](https://discord.gg/8Du7ZtJ).

Stats on crew:

Search for best crew for gauntlet, voyage or based on their stats, traits and names:

Analyze beholds and get stats and recommendations:

If you want to add the bot to your own fleet server, please contact me for details (see below for instructions).

## Setup instructions

Before inviting the bot to your Discord server, make sure you have set up these emojis which the bot depends on. Also, if possible, restrict the bot to specific channels; it will attempt to download and analyze all images (in case they are beholds), which puts a big stress on the server.

Download the emoji images here:
[chrons](/media/emoji/chrons.png) [honor](/media/emoji/honor.png) [cmd](/media/emoji/cmd.png) [dip](/media/emoji/dip.png) [eng](/media/emoji/eng.png) [med](/media/emoji/med.png) [sci](/media/emoji/sci.png) [sec](/media/emoji/sec.png)

Make sure the emojis have the same name as the file name. The emoji tab of your server settings should look like this after you add them:
