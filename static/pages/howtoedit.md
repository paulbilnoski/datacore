title: How to edit pages
---

The source of truth for all of the site content is [its GitHub repo](https://github.com/TemporalAgent7/datacore). All the crew pages are stored as Markdown with a few metadata entries in the /static/crew folder.

You can use the normal Git process for submitting changes (fork the repo, create a branch, make all the changes you want and submit a PR).

###Thank you!
