After years of playing the longsuffering straight man, season 7 badass Damar is here to [_chew bubblegum and kick ass_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1d8etj8ALVA), but he's all out of both. It's a shame to reduce such a heroic on-screen character to 'Budget Kahless', but seeing as the venerable clone is ahead of Damar in all of his skill pairs, it's a true statement. With a Cardassian mega his likeliest path to non-gauntlet relevance, it's best to take [_one star of Damar_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2775zMN_bo) as a gauntlet stopgap while you upgrade other parts of your roster.
