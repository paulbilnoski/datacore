He may be a bad dad, a very, very bad dad, but The Bashirs are easily the best of the three duo legendary cards the game has produced so far, practically by default. That still does not make them particularly good, as their best chance at regular use, their #7 DIP/SCI voyage total, is limited by their four rare-ish traits and is surrounded by options with stronger overall punch. In the age of the Arena one-shot kills, +9 Evasion at 4 seconds can have utility in the right lineups, but with practically zero chance at future events or collections and bases not quite strong enough to merit non-bonus shuttle work, there just don't seem to be enough avenues to relevance to justify the Tuesday pack roulette.
