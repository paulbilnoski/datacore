Double 1k bases for what we have to assume are plenty of future events and above average voyage numbers for an option-deficient skill set. There are only three SEC/SCI voyagers rated higher and when there's that kind of exclusivity, the totals matter less; he's guaranteed a seat. He lost a bit of shine when the latest Disco mega introduced a new #1 SCI base, but the fact that this note even includes the phrase "latest Disco mega" is another great reason to get him on your roster.
