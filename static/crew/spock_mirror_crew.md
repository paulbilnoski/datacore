He's not a crew that will make many voyages, even considering his useful skill set. It's best to think of him as a 2-skiller with a huge event count. Including his megas, he's averaged an event bonus every six weeks. That sort of usage can make even bad bases relevant. An equally unique offering is arena accuracy activating at one second with healthy passive values. He's an excellent compliment to fast activating crew which can save you a lot of time in skirmishes.
