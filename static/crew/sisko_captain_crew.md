Stop right here, if he is in your roster DO NOT AIRLOCK HIM. In the current state of the game CO Sisko is only available by accepting the achievement for changing your in-game name. This means if you don't accept it he will sit there happily until you have the honor to cite and freeze him. But once he's gone there is no going back.
