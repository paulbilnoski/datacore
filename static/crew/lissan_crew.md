A late 2018 Andorian standalone event gave Lissan and her kind a glimmer of hope, though it was more than likely a flash in the pan. Her 1100+ base is quite adequate for event work, but with traits that would seem to support spotty weekend relevance at best. On the daily use front, she leverages two fairly even proficiencies into a top three gauntlet pair. We like to see at least one big roll for our gauntlet crew to pick up wins against odd combos and 1-for-2s, but when her traits align, she's usable as a 5th gauntlet crew.
