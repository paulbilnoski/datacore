If this is the man you're counting on to buoy Jeffrey Hunter's Pike card to relevance, it's time to let that dream go. Instead, crack open a nice, cold, refreshing Disco Pike. There are some fringe benefits here, but the main usefulness you'll glean from this card lies in the good ol' base and voyage work. The CMD ranks are quite Disco heavy already so Pike's base only translates to fourth among Disco crew. Still strong for Factions and daily shuttles, even if it doesn't carry the dominance that a Tilly or Culber enjoyed for over a year. On voyages, only a handful of crew with his skill set are rated better and since you're unlikely to collect them all, he's certainly good enough to contribute a CMD primary in the same amount as the heralded Mirror Jean-Luc Picard.
