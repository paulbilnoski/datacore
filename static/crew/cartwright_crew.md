It seems strange to see a respectable stat like Joseph Sisko's Cartwright's CMD ranked this low. He's a zero for events, a zero for voyages, a zero for the gauntlet, and only passable in the arena. In a typical Faction event there are currently over 200 crew who, with a 2x bonus, are better than a 5/5 Cartwright and several more that rank a bit lower, but perform better because of their bonus affecting skill boosts. Don't let a big base sucker you in if they don't have events in which to use them and offer nothing else.
