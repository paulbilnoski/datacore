Her base/event pairing is obvious, but she also owns the honorific of being one of two Legendary crew to qualify for three stat-boosting collections. That alone is an important consideration and makes adding a star to her more important than with other crew. In the event of an(other) all-Disco mega, her DIP is within 25 points of #1 L'Rell.
