Fake Tucker or ~~Fucker~~ Fake Tucker, as I like to call him, was born with a disappointing voyage total that's only gotten lower. Now that ENG/SEC options have flooded in during Q2 2019, he shouldn't be on too many players' voyages, but his outlook is rosier elsewhere. Two interesting collections in which legendary crew still matter and a usable ENG base, even if he's only had a half dozen event opportunities to this point. Not elite in any area, but a name that will come up from time to time.
