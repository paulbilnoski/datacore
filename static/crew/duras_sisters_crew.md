"Human females are so repulsive!" Not quite as repulsive as the thought of throwing away quite as much time and effort on bad crew as these two require, but here you are. Klingon + Brutal events might give you a reason to use them on the weekend, but outside of some potent arena utility (10s for +9 Attack) and fledgling Gauntlet pairs, even a complete non-starter like Miral Torres matches them for dedicated event work. A putrid voyage total with this skill set just isn't worth the time once you've gotten your sea legs.
