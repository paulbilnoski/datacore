[_"Human females are so repulsive!"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgRzyichD40) Not quite as repulsive as the thought of throwing away quite as much time and effort on bad crew as these two require, but here you are. Klingon + Brutal events might give you a reason to use them on the weekend, but outside of some potent arena utility (10s for +9 Attack) and fledgling Gauntlet pairs, even a complete non-starter like Miral Torres matches them for dedicated event work. A putrid voyage total with this skill set just isn't worth the time once you've gotten your sea legs.
