It's rare that you manage to double down on a card that I likened to unpasteurised milk, but hey, we're all capable of great things when we try. Meet Lt. Commander Uhura's inferior little sister, with an added +1 Diplomat, but a third of the event count. A lot has been made of the mega event survey that we were asked to fill out months ago, with speculation as to future trait relevance going through the roof, but sadly, we're approaching the point where the crew pools on some of those mega options are getting too bloated for a mega, so I wouldn't bank on Romantic getting any play aside from perhaps a one off in the future. 

Beyond that, Lwaxana doesn't have much to offer besides raw, easily creeped power - just ask Acting Captain Jellico, who slid one base rank down in the course of a week - to the point where I'll bet a legendary citation that I'll be writing another variation on this note in a month's time. Granted, I doubt that note will give me an opportunity to mention that Lwaxana now has more legendary variants than Chakotay, and as many as McCoy and Scotty. . . then again, their value may not be Lwaxing, but they won't find themselves Lwaning as quickly as this particular card. Ehh? Ehh?
