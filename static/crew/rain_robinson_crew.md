It's a shame that the scales are tipped in favor of Rain's dual 1k bases which, to date, have not snagged a single event bonus. If the numbers were shifted a bit, they could push a #5 SCI/ENG gauntlet pair past even the freakasaurus Caretaker. Alas, she remains a competent voyager who, if starred up, should have no problem taking over daily shuttle duty from super rares.
