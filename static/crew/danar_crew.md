One of the better non-event values in the portal. He offers double collections including the super tough Jury Rigger and workable voyage numbers with a smatter of traits suited for antimatter, if not events. You don't want to pass on 1-4* Jury Riggers too often and his voyage prowess will also serve you fine into the mid-game.
