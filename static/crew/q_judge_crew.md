Top 50 proficiency numbers might catch the eye, but they're spread too evenly to present much of a gauntlet punch, especially with few traits to back up the numbers. His SEC base is #1 among Qs (#2 and #3 within 10 points) and like a black unicorn flying across a rainbow, I did actually see him used as a faction share once in a Q event as the best available option. He's probably better deployed in the arena. +9 EV with respectable passive numbers activates fast enough and lasts long enough for almost any battle.
