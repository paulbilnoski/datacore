Killy rules the ship battles with an iron fist and is similar to gauntleteers in that if you have a chance to grab her first star, you do it. Pair her with some fast activating crit crew like Ardra/Karr/Scott and rake in the rewards from four or six second ship battles. She will literally save you hours of gameplay over the course of countless arena dailies and skirmishes and unlike the aforementioned gauntlet counterparts, does benefit well from extra stars (you'll want to get her to +9/10 attack for those one shots or spend another seat for an attack crew).

That being said, Killy's usefulness is clearly on the decline. Her event count is propped up by four previous mega events and though that may or may not continue, her variant events have been strangely lacking. Disco (her primary event consideration) CMD options have sprung up around her and her voyage work is now merely average. Two crew from 2019 stole her arena credentials which also steals some of the value that came from its exclusivity. She remains well rounded and the impact of her shipboard work is significant, but a sinking relative effectiveness should be considered, especially on the topic of adding stars.
