While this particular variant is as boring as dollar store vanilla ice cream, she's still a warm and able body for Factions. Narrow window as quick +Acc arena crew would seemingly be her only other use - but wait! There's more! Just like Tuvix, the Duras Sisters and the Bynars, this particular Janeway can now be fused with Mutated Paris to form Evolved Janeway, an above average legendary with superlative DIP/SCI and a place in every Voyager fan's heart. Don't be so quick to airlock her when you see her anymore - each copy is one step closer to that great big salamander in the sky.
