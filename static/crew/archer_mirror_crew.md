Double digit events for an Archer?! What is this, the Mirror Universe? Actually, yea. And even though two previous megas have inflated his event count, [_M'Archer_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpQGCfBqyl4) may be able to call on a few more traits down the line to "highlight" a pair of mediocre bases for your requisition shuttles. He's not suitable for daily use, but will likely be a name to consider for the odd event here and there.
