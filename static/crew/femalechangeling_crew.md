Seven Dominion, two Changeling, one Brutal event and a partridge in a pear tree is more event work than we figured to get out of the Founder. But that may be immaterial with bases so poor that you likely need four or five stars on her before the event even begins. She's fine as a [_Dominion/DIP node unlock_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Feed_A_Fever), but for her to earn a roster spot as a repeat contributor, you'll be leaning on her #2 CMD/DIP gauntlet pair or fast shipboard evasion.
