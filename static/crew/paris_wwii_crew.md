Medic's strong voyage MED is paired with two trickier skill combos to give him 8+ hour staying power. Nine of Paris' twelve events have had a Faction component and he has two features in Galaxy events (10x bonus) - great news for the owner of the #1 MED base. He's all-star for the less represented MED skill and shrugs off sinking voyage numbers with a skill set that among legendary crew only Warship EMA shares.
