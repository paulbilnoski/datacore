Ba'ku Worf, now with kung-fu grip! Polarized crew; either a zero or ðŸ’¯ depending on the area. Big event count paired with a top SEC base is good enough for shuttle use into the mid-game while being a great faction event crew for the long haul. His instant damage in the arena is unlikely to go out of style.
