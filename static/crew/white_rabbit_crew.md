This is not a drill. The Rabbit [_is real and he's _](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQNkeugaAMc)[~~_spectacular_~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQNkeugaAMc) not bad. Let's get the zeroes out of the way first, because there are plenty of those. Not offering much (read: anything) for the arena, gauntlet, collections, events, or traits, he's more of a daily shuttle and voyage contributor. The value of a big base [_which is not among the more useful skills_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycUq3J1E4xr1z4Pe6BfT56-M1SBaEYtWsl-O4oPwxlk/edit#bookmark=id.nqn5lerzhcsq), nor has a realistic chance to ever catch a bonus (costumed mega confirmed) is dubious. But if you somehow have a fused Rabbit from its weekday 6-pack and no mega event Ru'afo, then you're in a pretty unique situation and he may leverage his ENG into some weekend help. By the numbers it's still strong, even if we'd like to see it attached to a more common event character or a bevy of traits.

The majority of his value to your roster will come on voyages. Rabbit is one of two legendaries in the game (Imprinted Archer being the other) to have ENG and MED as its top two skills, which means that  [_for that voyage combo_](https://i.imgur.com/bYSjYzd.png), at least, he has a hind leg up on the competition. For the accompanying SCI/MED and ENG/SCI runs, he's going to contribute a tertiary skill that's often lacking in those crew. In short, his skill set and particularly skill order is great and will serve to inflate his voyage value. Rabbit's holes are certainly substantial, but you'll still see plenty of daily use from him even if he's lacking elsewhere.
