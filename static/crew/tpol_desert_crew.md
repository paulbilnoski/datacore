The bulk of T'Pol's value will come from voyages, and she ranks quite well there, with the #5 voyage total and #1 SCI/SEC score, besting former #1 Fugitive Spock by a fairly significant margin. In a skill combo that is always difficult to fill adequately, that kind of power matters. T'Pol also has a solid event count, and brings a variant-best SEC and #3 SCI base to her weekends on duty, which means she ought to find a shuttle seat more often than not, even if her bases tend toward good-not-great.
