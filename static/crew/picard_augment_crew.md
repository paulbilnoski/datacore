Even though Picard's event count has yet to catch up with his ridiculous number of variants, Augment's SEC sits on the top of the heap and, in combination with a couple traits, has popped up in double-digit events. I can't promise a CMD/DIP/SEC crew with his voyage total will make too many runs for you, but it's more of a perk that event-similar 2-skill crew lack. He remains a solid event contributor, but you may find him otherwise limited.
