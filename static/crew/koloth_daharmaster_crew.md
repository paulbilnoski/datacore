[_Trelane's alter ego_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXV5ciE8ucE&t=64) is all business this time around. His voyage metrics are excellent and don't need any nitpicking, despite his skill set. He even has a puncher's chance in the gauntlet despite a middling ranked pair, because of the Dahar Master crit trait which he only has to share with two other crew. The raw gauntlet numbers don't allow him the dominance he enjoys elsewhere, but in combination with a handful of 45-65% trait sets do offer a bit of extra value to an otherwise strong card.

Three holes of varying sizes in his game are an unappealing arena offering, the most replaceable skill set, and limited event chances. Koloth's traits have combined for a respectable event count thus far, but include two one-off trait events and the Klingon mega. It's unlikely that his event rate will continue going forward, but he'll knock it out of the park every once in a while with the #1 Klingon SEC base.
