Not your standard crew consideration; Bev is available in a specific place for a specific price. Since her debut, she's remained firmly in Kahless' shadow. True, she doesn't measure up to him in most gauntlets, but few do. She's still very quality and any quibbles about her usually center around her cost. Four ranked gauntlet pairs, including a firm hold on the #1 MED/CMD combo, is a good place to start. But despite a top five MED proficiency, there are a few chinks in the armor. Her five traits don't collect crit bonuses quite as often as some gauntleteers and the MED ranks are overrun by more accessible super rare crew. She'll do fine as one of your gauntlet five, but don't expect her to be head and shoulders above her peers.

On voyages, she's guaranteed a seat for at least a few different combos as she's one of just three MED/CMD voyagers. The raw numbers matter a bit less for combos which lack options and Bev will certainly be an upgrade for MED/CMD runs, no matter who else you own. Crusher event work is spotty on a good day; her variants have only claimed one weekend per year and traits may double that, at best. In combination with great daily use value (shuttles excluded), events are just the cherry on top. Whether she's worth the honor cost when legendary crew are so easy to obtain is another conversation, but in terms of card quality, Bev is unquestionably a crew that everyone can use.
