Fennim is best deployed on voyages where his skill set is somewhat uncommon for the top half of the voyage ranks - all those above him being pack-only gems. He has a handful of juicy traits which work fine for voyages and story nodes, even if they're not particularly eventable. Two ranked gauntlet pairs are worth at least a mention, but neither are particularly powerful and he lacks a single big roll to give him a chance when his skill pairs don't align.
