Fennim is best deployed on voyages where his skill set is somewhat uncommon for the top half of the voyage ranks and is accompanied by traits which work fine for voyages and story nodes, even if they're not particularly eventable. Two ranked gauntlet pairs are worth at least a mention, but neither are particularly powerful and he lacks a single big roll to give him a chance when his skill pairs don't align.
