A less than inspiring SEC stat with a bad CMD base make this edition of Reed one of the worst 3* cards available. SEC/CMD is such a common pairing and there are plenty of other cards with better numbers in both. His one saving grace is 200% damage in ship battles but that is easily replaceable with Commando Crusher or Tourist Dax.
