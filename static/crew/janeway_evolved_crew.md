From the depths of a coffee-starved writers' room comes this curiously potent monstrosity. Fusing Captain Janeway and Mutated Paris will produce this love child and her love children. Big base and voyage numbers make her the best fusion crew yet and with Janeway events rebounding in short order to begin 2019, you're likely to get good use out of a variant-best DIP base that edges out collection-only Lucille Davenport by 80 points. The top of the voyage ranks are loaded with DIP/SCI, but being able to build-a-bear your way to a strong crew has value on its own and is far preferable to a paltry amount of honor.
