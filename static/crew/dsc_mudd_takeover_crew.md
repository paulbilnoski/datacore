A close enough replica of Prisoner O'Brien that you'd swear he was constructed on the planet Mudd. Top 1/3rd voyage (and voyage ENG) numbers with dual 700+ bases for Mudd and Disco event work. A good chunk of his value hinges on possible future Disco mega(s) where he owns the #1 ENG base for super rare crew.
