If you smell what the Chef is cooking, you'd know he's serving up a pretty tasty dish, with just a hint of that "taken from the god-awful _Enterprise_ finale" aroma to add complexity to the bouquet. As the only Riker with MED and SCI as well as a hefty DIP base, Chef Riker is the rare main cast card where all three of his skills are variant-best. Riker's event history is slow but steady, and the possibility of a Costumed event or mega could help his chances of catching extra work in the future. He doesn't pop elsewhere, with no Gauntlet prospects and a punchless ship ability, but his middling Voyage total is uniquely-skilled enough that he will probably find more work there than the raw numbers project. With the long history of underwhelming, underpowered Riker variants before him, it's pretty easy to call Chef the most useful of the bunch.
