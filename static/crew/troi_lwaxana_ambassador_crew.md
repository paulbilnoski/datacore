Lwaxana Troi, daughter of the Fifth House, holder of the Sacred Chalice of Rixx, heir to the Holy Rings of Betazed is actually okay for a 2-skill gauntleteer because of her ability to hit 65% crit. Unfortunately, that's just about all she offers. Her lack of events and terrible bases make chasing her spot in the Diplomat collection a fool's errand. For one star, she's a fine behold choice in some cases, but it's unwise to invest more than that.
