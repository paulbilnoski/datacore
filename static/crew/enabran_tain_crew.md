Another old gauntleteer who's fallen by the wayside. With constant walls of superior crew in front of all his skill pairs, you're not really considering using him without a crit advantage - which, to be fair, he often does pick up thanks to the Cardassian/Obsidian Order trait sets. He's one of several budget Kahless options, but does a poor imitation and it's generally only worth taking a single star of him. Some unrealized potential may appear in the form of a Cardassian mega event where he could contribute two usable-when-bonus bases, provided you (un)lucked into a few stars on him.
