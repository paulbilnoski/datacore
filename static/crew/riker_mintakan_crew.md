His event contributions look quite good on paper - top three Riker DIP and SEC with a fistful of eventable traits and a steady two+ Riker bonuses in each calendar year. Considering his dreary voyage, gauntlet, and arena power, he's best thought of as a luxury 2-skill event choice with more gas in the tank for weekends.
