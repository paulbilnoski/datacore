Don't let the skills fool you; his usage is among the worst in the game. ENG/SCI looks helpful for new players, but for voyages he's within 100 points of super rare crew despite a star advantage and his bases don't begin to beat out solid 4/4s until he has four stars himself. Soong's two event features, should they be re-run, will serve to help you win more copies of a bad card. His gauntlet pair has vanished from the ranks and leaves behind only a month or two of usability for brand new accounts.
