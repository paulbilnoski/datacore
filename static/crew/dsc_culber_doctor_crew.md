In the case of Disco crew embodying power creep, Culber is Exhibit A. His MED base is ~13% better than the next widely available option; former mega Bashir. For a skill like MED which has a fraction of the options that other skills do, that's a big difference. And just for good measure, he's a great Disco SCI shuttler too. The Discovery megas [_just don't stop coming_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K4oym9Pw48) and with them, Culber enjoys a huge jump in power as one of the most important crew in the game during those periods.

While we don't give much credit to 2-skill voyagers (for good reason), he  _is_  the #1 voyage MED, #1 voyage SCI+MED total and the #2 voyage total among 2-skill crew. In an ideal world, he doesn't make too many voyages, but this is a game of opportunity and chances are that if you FF Culber for his exemplary event bases, he will shove off on voyages considering the thin options elsewhere for voyage medics.
