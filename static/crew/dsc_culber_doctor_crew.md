You may be scrolling down the doc a bit further these days to find ol' Hugh. That sterling MED still looks pretty damn good for a nearly two year old crew, doesn't it? But the cracks are beginning to show, at least in an all-crew ranking. The voyage skill combo has gotten a handful of options recently; everything from event crew (Pulaski), to a 4-peat 6-pack offer (Tainer), to a highly sought after powerhouse (Cheesecake Seven), to a MED/SCI mega crew who comes out of the box at 4/5 (Qod).

Speaking of  [_His Omnipotence_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCls-lezNWg&t=75), the player base at large now has a fused crew who does a pretty good impersonation of Culber about 95 weeks out of 100. Between a MEDaissance, his event uncertainty,  [_another Disco Doc_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Dr._Pollard)  who's more useful outside of shuttles, and a Faction event change which limits the variety of shuttle seats across factions, Culber is hurtin' for certain, even if what he excels at is still unquestionably elite.
