You may be scrolling down the doc a bit further these days to find ol' Hugh. That sterling MED still looks pretty damn good for a nearly two year old crew, doesn't it? But the cracks are beginning to show, at least in an all-crew ranking. His voyage skill combo has gotten a handful of options recently; everything from event crew (Pulaski), to a 4-peat 6-pack offer (Tainer), to a highly sought after powerhouse (Cheesecake Seven), to a MED/SCI mega crew who comes out of the box at 4/5 (Qod).

Speaking of  [_His Omnipotence_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCls-lezNWg&t=75), the player base at large now has a fused crew who does a pretty good impersonation of Culber about 95 weeks out of 100. Between a MEDaissance, his event uncertainty,  [_another Disco Doc_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Dr._Pollard)  who's more useful outside of shuttles, and a Faction event change which limits the variety of shuttle seats across factions, Culber is hurtin' for certain, even if what he excels at is still unquestionably elite.

> If I've ever linked this before, now seems like the right time. A few months ago (and for a long time prior), Culber was the quintessential base MED crew with overall numbers good enough to sneak onto MED/SCI voyages. Since then we've had several voyage and base additions to his wheelhouse in all forms; 6-packs, fusion crew, megas, event crew. Even for Discovery events where plugging his huge base into your shuttles felt fantastic, we now have the more versatile Dr. Pollard to nearly equal him. Culber remains the class of the base medics, but it's no longer a one man show.
