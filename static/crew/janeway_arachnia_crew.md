Another crew who had a terrible 2018. DB continues to churn out stronger options as expected (including better DIP variants), but on top of that, Janeway's event count suddenly halted. With her voyage numbers dead last among all CMD/DIP/SEC legendaries, that sort of bonus dry spell can tank the desirability of any card. Her events have picked back up and a vanity collection spot and workable arena numbers are considerations, but her daily use is too poor to justify taking her for an event count which may rise, but likely not return to its previously stellar rate.
