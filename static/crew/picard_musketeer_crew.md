This holographic hero is a near clone of fellow variant Augment Picard, simply trading off some base power for better voyage and gauntlet numbers. If you have one, you probably don't need the other. Inspiring is a ironic collection choice for Musketeer as his skill set and stats are anything but. He'll still perform fine for a few events per year, but if you're looking for a daily workhouse, you can find better without too much effort. The exceptions may be for new players - on ships he has some minor Skirmish potential and in the gauntlet where he owns a #3 ranked pair, even if it is dwarfed by fan favorites Locutus and Gowron.
