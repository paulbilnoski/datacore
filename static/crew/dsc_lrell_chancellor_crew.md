Crew notes don't often begin with a warning, but L'Rell has a few hallmarks of a crew who doesn't age well; DIP primary, her bland skill set as a whole, and a massive Disco event bubble that may pop at any time. Nevertheless, she has one of the better base/voyage/event triads in the game. Of all the matching skill sets above her voyage power, only Quinn is DIP primary and her strong base is #1 among both Disco and Klingon crew. L'Rell just snagged her first event feature and if more were guaranteed, she would come more heartily recommended. Enjoy her power in the short term and if the Disco megas _don't_ stop, then you have a dynamite roster cornerstone.
