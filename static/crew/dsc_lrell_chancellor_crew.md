Crew notes don't often begin with a warning, but L'Rell has a few hallmarks of a crew who doesn't age well; DIP primary, CMD/DIP/SEC as a whole, and a massive Disco event bubble that may pop at any time. Nevertheless, as of this writing she's among the most stout base/voyage combos in the game. Of the three matching skill sets above her voyage power, none are DIP primary and her elite base is #1 among both Disco and Klingon crew. L'Rell just snagged her first event feature and if more were guaranteed, she would come more heartily recommended. Enjoy her remarkable power in the short term and if the Disco megas don't stop, then you have a dynamite roster cornerstone.
