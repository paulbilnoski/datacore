Before I talk about this card, I just want to remind you all that Scotty has two legendary variants in this game, and both of them are fairly terrible to just barely mediocre. Now I want to remind you that this could very easily have been Redjac Scotty, and I think I can imagine your disappointment. Right, now that that's done, let's talk about this particular wolf in the fold. Rather reminiscent of Colonel Q, but what a difference 400% instant damage makes to your long term prospects, eh? A cookie cutter skill set, a new top ten base, a sub-50 voyage score - very much in the mould of almost everyone that's been released this year, which makes it harder and harder to pick between them, but if your set-up lacks a +Acc and you don't want to go with the meta of Ardra/Scott and co., Jaris is an easily justified quick shot that will find a home with you. Just don't expect him to put in any event work - his best shot is Villain, and unless you start hearing [_maniacal laughs_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6MlHxAzLXA) in the distance, there are better crew to chase.
