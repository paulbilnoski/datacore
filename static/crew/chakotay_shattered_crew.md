He's unabashedly my favorite card, but I swear my crush is justified. Irreplaceable (top 5) on voyages for all permutations of his skill set with double 1k bases. His events are sadly as rare as his skill set (Only 5* SEC/ENG/MED), but two recent events in rapid succession after a long, long drought give hope for the future.
