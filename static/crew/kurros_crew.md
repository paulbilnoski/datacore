Kurros [_is a hell of a story teller_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0u8KUgUqprw), but his stats tell the true tale of limited use. Arena evasion better than his is not hard to find and although he has a handful of trait event possibilities, his thawpertunities will be erratic and undependable. Consider him +1 to an increasingly easy collection with a few events as a possible perk.
