If you've ever wondered why they called it spiced Nog, look no further. Tuxedo has a dash of everything and comes out smelling pretty good. A half dozen events with a base nearing 1100 is a useful enough duo. Dependable voyage work with a convenient ENG tertiary. And rounded out by triple collections and passable, if a hair slow, arena EV. Tux will rarely generate buzz, but is useful enough to be a complementary piece on a well-rounded roster.
