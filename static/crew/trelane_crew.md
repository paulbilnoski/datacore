His bases aren't worth considering until/unless one of his several juicy traits hit the Mega lottery, but the plucky Trelane has the skill set and proficiency to earn voyage and gauntlet work. His single gauntlet pair definitely has a half-life on it with current reward Armus besting him there and a couple non-portal options bound to join us in 2019, but he still hits 65% crit from time to time. His voyage appearances will come thanks to his skill set which is Trelane's saving grace is the face of rapidly sinking stat ranks.
