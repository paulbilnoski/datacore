 Most people don't think "powerhouse" when they see Quark's shapely lobes, but this variant very nearly is. Great voyage numbers and only two crew rated higher have better MED. Two very usable bases for Quark's double-digit events, and +1 Ferengi collection give him several avenues to contribute. Only 11 Ferengi items required to FE make him a bargain.
