2018 delivered our yearly Wesley event in the 11th hour. For all those who lamented airlocking or passing on a Wesley because he happened to catch an event, stop it. You still made the right choice. And passing on the Lieutenant is the right choice more often than not. He offers (very) thin value in most places outside of the arena where he provides some usable arena EV. A previously uncommon ENG/SEC stack for voyages had a huge influx in Q2 of 2019 and so Wes' prospects are fading fast there too. If you want to get an A, pass on Wes and don't feel bad when his once a year event rolls around.
