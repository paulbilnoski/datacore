Everywhere you look at Kim's stats, they seem miserably underpowered. It's likely that his ENG sandwiched by some CMD/DIP/SEC crew will seem appealing on the behold screen, but his stats don't really support daily use past the early game. Until recently he had the market cornered on Kim events (which have only produced a _single _Faction event), but you'll get much more mileage out of the superior Captain Harry now. An uncommon voyage stack had been propping up what little value Beowulf offers, but Q2 2019 loaded us up with ENG/SEC options and so his outlook is worsening there too. If you're after the Janeway in his non-vanity vanity collection, you're probably better off spending honor to finish her and skipping both Kim and Odo while immortalizing the other fine crew in that group.
