Everywhere you look at Kim's stats, they seem miserably underpowered. It's likely that his ENG sandwiched by some CMD/DIP/SEC crew will seem appealing on the behold screen, but his stats don't really support daily use past the early game. Until recently he had the market cornered on Kim events, but you'll get much more mileage out of the superior Captain Harry now. An uncommon voyage stack is helping prop up what little value he offers. If you're after the Janeway in his non-vanity vanity collection, you're probably better off spending honor to finish her and skipping both Kim and Odo while immortalizing the other fine crew in that group.
