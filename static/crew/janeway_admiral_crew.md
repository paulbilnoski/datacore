Janeway events are popping up again in 2019, but with poor bases beside, [_"Admiral Jane"_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708922/quotes/qt0970104) has one life line; a unique arena ability. Her sub-200 voyage rank is red alert, even for an uncommon skill set, and she may need a few stars to pitch in for events, but her best attribute is in the arena where formidable passive stats and EV comes online at one second; early enough to help protect you from anything that your opponents can throw at you.
