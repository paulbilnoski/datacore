Lal's value is extremely polarized and therefore hard to rank in a vacuum. Her big base ENG is even ahead of 5/5s like Emo Chip Data, North Star Tucker and Seven of Nine. As long as she's occupying a shuttle seat in faction events, she has value. But once replaced there she offers almost nothing aside from a good-not-great +Attack in arena. If you're cruising along in the early or mid game, the odds are high that she can find meaningful work for you.
