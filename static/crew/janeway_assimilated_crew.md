Racial traits and high event crew go together like peanut butter and chocolate. 2018 gave us a huge scare for this card when Janeway events dried up and her event value limped along on the back of the Captain's Oath re-run and non-bonus work. But 2019 told us it's not crunch time yet and her event chances rebounded. Regardless of a streaky event history, she's still strong for daily use with a SCI base that edges out former mega Surak and the game isn't quite replete with SCI/CMD voyage options, despite several recent additions. The Borg collection still requires a legendary crew to complete and Borgway is as good a choice as any to FF.
