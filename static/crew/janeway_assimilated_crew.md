Racial traits and main cast characters [_go together like peanut butter and chocolate_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJLDF6qZUX0). 2018 gave us a huge scare for this card when Janeway events dried up and her event value limped along on the back of the Captain's Oath re-run and non-bonus work. But 2019 told us [_it's not crunch time yet_](https://i.gifer.com/BVya.gif) and her event chances rebounded. Regardless of a streaky event history, she's still strong for daily use with a SCI base that edges out former mega Surak and the game isn't quite replete with SCI/CMD voyage options, despite several recent additions. Though the Borg collection no longer requires a legendary crew to complete, Borgway is still as good a choice as any to FF.
