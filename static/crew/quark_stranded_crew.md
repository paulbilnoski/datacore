DIP/ENG/MED is one of the most important skill sets in the game by virtue of it being so scarce. Only super rare Rianna Mayweather shares it and even if other crew trickle in, that won't do much to diminish its authority. Still lagging leagues behind the pack in terms of power is the ENG+MED pairing. With so much of its representation scattered between the secondaries and tertiaries of various crew, any semblance of power has a great advantage over other, thinner options.

Enter Stranded Quark; owner of the best voyage total among ENG/MED crew. He's a great option for several different skill combos and his pristine skill set ensures an enduring usefulness ala Temporal Prisoner Chakotay or Delta Flyer Paris. Quark is equally desirable for events thanks to a huge 2018 representation, handful of traits, and the possibility of a Ferengi mega, wherein all three of his bases would be a top two option. In the gauntlet you generally want a bit more room to maneuver than a single ranked pair, but at least it's in the right skill combo to try and knock off The Caretaker and adds a sliver of value to an already outstanding card.
