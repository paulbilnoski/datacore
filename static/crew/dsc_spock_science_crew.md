Look at that event count. Just look at it. Now look at it knowing you'd be bringing the #1 SCI base for all Spock and Disco events (and #3 Spock and #8 Disco CMD base for good measure) to the party. If Beardless Spock did nothing else for your roster, he would still be quite possibly the busiest weekend warrior this game may ever see. Luckily, he also checks in with the #2 CMD/SCI voyage total (behind only First Officer Burnham) and SCI/CMD bases big enough to fill shuttles any time he's not occupied, which won't be often. Don't even bother clearing a spot on the bench for him, he'll never sit long enough to keep a seat warm.
