No one in the world is going to recommend this card to anyone. His SEC skill is alright but his ENG and CMD scores are abysmal. His ship skill could be useful combined with a cloakable vessel and a high attack score but he won't be in demand on your roster once you unlock the Klingon node in the cadet challenges. Best to show him the airlock once better SEC staff come through.
