Two usable bases puts her near the top of a couple different traits' 'best of' lists. If/when they crop up, she'll be a valuable weekend resource, but until then she's almost a total dud of an investment. She may pop up on a few voyages out of necessity for very new players due to her MED, but will fade into obscurity in the mid-game and beyond. If you select her as a character choice, you'll be hoping for a Cardassian or Bajoran mega, like the several other racial events that have come before.

The April mega teaser swerved us, but if you started preparing your Cardassians for service you may have noticed Ziyal's potential impact. I still don't think she's worth spending behold capital on if you're expecting any concrete value, but with Cardassian, Bajoran (1st event in March), and even Romantic megas a possibility, it's better to acquire those sort of crew before their events and not after.
