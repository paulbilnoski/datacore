Hailing from [_an all-time bad episode of Trek_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m83yPrgzv4) is one way to be remembered. Another is to own some serious in-game power. Ms. Earhart was tucked away in a weekday pack alongside President Lincoln and so may have been overlooked by some, but she's a diamond in the rough. If you owned her for the Pilot mega to close out 2018, congratulations on your enormous advantage over the field. With an April curtain call, [_she came back better than ever_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGY1J9XTXuw) boasting a ~300 point lead over the next likely option for another month (because who the hell has a FF Tosk?).

It's hard to see her squeeze much more weekend relevance from her traits (cultural figure?), but her elite base can't be denied the rest of the time, even if it sits behind a crew that most players have immortalized. Her shuttle potential is obvious, but even more impressive is her reign as the top voyage ENG which is nearing a full calendar year. #1 overall voyager Braxton may have pipped her for ENG+CMD voyages, but she still has great job security on any roster. To ensure that, and help make up for any event deficiencies, Earhart snags two spots in the gauntlet rankings, including a DIP/ENG pair capable of 2-for-1ing The Caretaker.
