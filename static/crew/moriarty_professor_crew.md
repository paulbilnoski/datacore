The Hologram mega was the first foray into odd trait megas and made several old crew notes of mine look foolish. Other such out-of-left-field mega events have me wildly speculating about potential future traits that may bring crew into relevance. A villain mega may make The Professor a fearsome shuttle DIP, or perhaps he never snags another event bonus. Regardless, his voyage power/skill set combo remains usable enough to merit consideration in a behold against poor cards or luxury event 2-skillers.
