Voyage power around the top 50 at the time of the first Big Book has dropped tremendously since then as have the ranks of his now embarrassing bases. Moriarty is still close to average for voyages, but the only thing he really offers most rosters is unrealized event potential via a handful of traits. Not the worst crew statistically, but someone you can easily do without.
