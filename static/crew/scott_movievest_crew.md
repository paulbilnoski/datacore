Mr. Doohan, please forgive me for that little voyage rib. He's got one skill - no one should be surprised at learning he's a bad card. But he's certainly not _the worst_ card. He has a few useful offerings while some cards can't even claim one _good _attribute. His Jury Rigger qualifies him for what is still the most exclusive stat-boosting collection. There are enough "good" cards to finish it without Scotty, but in a game of opportunity, it's unlikely that you'll find them all.

However it's his shipboard prowess that's worth the price of admission. He's a powerful arena and Skirmish asset who hits the trifecta of strong boost (+9 accuracy), fast activation (4 sec), and the best passive stats in the game. Heaps and oodles of crit, accuracy, and evasion make him formidable there, even with a single star. Much like gauntleteers, if you want to snag one copy of him to boost your Skirmish game, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
