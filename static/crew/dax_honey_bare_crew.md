Some of us had posters of Kelly Kapowski or Rachel Green hanging in our bedrooms. Others had Jadzia Dax. If you're the latter, this is the crew that you want. There's no point in quibbling about which variant has the best bases when you have the event count (+ Hologram) and popularity that Dax does. Her voyage number are rock solid to boot. Finally we can feel good about spending citations on a vanity collection crew.
