A 900 DIP base with fairly uncommon ENG secondary and a reasonable +7 arena EV at 6 seconds. Hope for a re-run of one of her two event features once she makes her way from shuttle to freezer. I'd love to rank her higher for such a strong/common shuttle base - feel free if she would be one of your top DIP bases - but such little chance at long term value makes it hard to do so.
