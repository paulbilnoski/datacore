If you ever want to grab my attention, show me a Klingon with a rare skill set. And Alexander here is no exception, sporting a quite frankly gorgeous top 10 SCI base, a top 25 voyage total, +1 Diplomat, Klingon + Temporal Agent events to bolster his weekend chances, and an instant 300% damage ship ability! Exactly what we want from our non-main cast cards.
