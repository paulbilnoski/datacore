Some may look at [_Janeway, Vice_](https://youtu.be/zcKk22LNdJE?t=29), and merely see a Braxton clone - very similar skill sets (SEC vs SCI tertiary), a better base, but nearly sixty paces apart when it comes to voyages. Which would be a fairer comparison if she weren't sitting on twice his event count, a base that will easily make non-bonus shuttles (unlike Braxton, who will be sitting in line behind _Grateful Lwaxana(!)_), and a variant best CMD for a character who may not be quite the event queen she used to be, but she's staging quite the comeback. Now, I could sit here prattling about stat rankings and events until the cows come home. But it's Endgame Jane! If nothing else, she has Cool Factor, and if you're hemming and hawing over taking her over someone technically, statistically better but lamer, someone with five minutes of screen time, then [_to hell with it_](https://youtu.be/M3CT_qVzL84?t=90). Break out the transphasic torpedoes and [_pick a badass_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnWicYtCFuU).
