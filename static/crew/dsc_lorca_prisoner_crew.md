The distinction of being the only 4* Lorca and the attendant Disco + Mirror event count are almost enough to make you look past the fact that this particular Lorca is all gun, no fun. As another warm body to fill shuttle seats, he's going to do you just fine most weekends of the year, but when that same roster of Disco + Mirror crew is fit to burst with CMD/SEC crew, you want to do better than just fine. If you're expecting anything else, then apart from some particularly fine art to stare at, you're sadly out of luck. Ah, well. Cheer yourself up by watching a real hero at work.
