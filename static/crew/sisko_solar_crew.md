Dark horse for one of my favorite crew in the game. He expertly blends a mirror-esque beard with such fatherly traits as Caregiver and Chef. His ENG base is not only variant-best, but until recently the only variant ENG. For some of his events which don't feature other ENG characters (Alpha and Omega 2), he'll have a stat edge of over 1,000 points. Fantastic daily use numbers are worthy of adding stars to in order to eventually pick up double tough collection spots in Diplomat and Inspiring.
