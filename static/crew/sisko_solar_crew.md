Dark horse for one of my favorite crew in the game. He expertly blends a mirror-esque beard with such fatherly traits as Caregiver and Chef. His ENG base is not only variant-best, but until recently the only variant ENG. For some of his events which don't feature other ENG characters (Alpha and Omega 2), he'll have a stat edge of over 1,000 points. Workable daily use numbers are worthy of adding stars to in order to eventually pick up double tough collection spots in Diplomat and Inspiring.

> Like Survivalist Kirk before him, Solar Sisko's value takes a hit with his offering as a global gift. His ENG lead for Sisko events loses over 300 points moving from Ru'afo as competition to a 1/5 Solar Sisko. Still a unique crew for events and worth acquiring for that purpose, but with so many big ENG bases added mid-2019 and an ever sinking voyage total ready to drop out of the top 100, Sisko may slide down your citation and behold priorities.
