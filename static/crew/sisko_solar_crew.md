Dark horse for one of my favorite crew in the game. He expertly blends a mirror-esque beard with such fatherly traits as Caregiver and Chef. His ENG base is not only variant-best, but until recently the only variant ENG. For some of his events which don't feature other ENG characters (Alpha and Omega 2), he'll have a stat edge of over 1,000 points. Workable daily use numbers are worthy of adding stars to in order to eventually pick up double tough collection spots in Diplomat and Inspiring.

> Recent events have highlighted how certain configurations of featured characters make Solar Sisko a huge asset thanks to ENG and SCI values that are not common among other variants and traitholders. In events where he's the only real ENG option, he contributes almost 1100 points more than #1 base Ru'afo.
