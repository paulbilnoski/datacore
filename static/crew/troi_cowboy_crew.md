With such an effective base/event pairing, her skill set and voyage efficacy, or lack thereof, can be excused. Her efficacy has been dented somewhat by the debut of Cruella de Troi, who can contribute very similarly in events, but who isn't hampered by Durango's severely power creeped voyage offerings and vanilla skill set, so keep that in mind if you were lucky enough to snatch her Dark Empath counterpart. That being said, Durango's SEC base is still perfect for common shuttle seating in faction events, even when not bonus, and there's no denying that she can make your weekends go much smoother. Just keep in mind that her time in the Spaghetti Western sun is coming to an end.
