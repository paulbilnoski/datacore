With such an effective base/event pairing, her skill set and voyage efficacy, or lack thereof, can be excused. Something to consider; her SEC base is 712 points better than the #2 variant and in certain event situations you may be looking at a percentage points difference in your favor for every shuttle and crafting node. Not to mention that her SEC is perfect for common shuttle seating in faction events, even when not bonus. There's no denying that she can make your weekends go much smoother.
