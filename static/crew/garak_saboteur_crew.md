From arguably the best episode in the history of Star Trek comes inarguably the best version of Garak to come to Timelines. He is tailor-made (*groan*) for the weekend, with variant-best SEC and ENG bases paired with an event count that seems to be picking up speed and could hit on any of several potential eventable traits. He's no slouch for daily use either, with a SEC/ENG Voyage total stout enough to stand alongside the recently-released Conditioned La Forge and Delta Flyer Torres, if maybe a half step behind, and a 400% damage ship ability that is a near-copy of Enemy Lines Sisko, which pairs excellently with a Killy/RP Commandant to make a strong one-two punch for Arena and Skirmishes. I don't know about you, but I'd call that a bargain.
