Rock solid for daily use, Lorian is also one of the gatekeepers to the Jury Rigger collection. Unless you cite some bad crew or wait for DB to release more, you're going to need to immortalize the superb T'Pucker love child. Sitting just outside the top ten for both base and voyage ENG, he also has the chance to snag an occasional Vulcan event bonus, but is strong value even without them. If you want a laugh, check out his arena page where an odd mix of crit rating and +EV activate after a Solar Beam-esque 18 seconds.
