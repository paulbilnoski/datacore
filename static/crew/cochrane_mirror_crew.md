Just a few tweaks away from being great crew, but Zef is still useful. Dual 1k bases paired with several eventable traits grant occasional weekend value and his skill order among 5*s is shared by only two other crew. Not a candidate for citations unless you're nearing the threshold of his collections, but someone you should be glad to snag from a behold.
