Well-statted, but not particularly interesting, Vina is the type of crew who pushes other, more notable names (Bartender Guinan [voyage], Zhian'tara Odo [base]) down the ranks without you noticing. That sort of company alone makes her a crew worth considering, but there are holes to her game. DIP is, frankly, too easy to acquire despite its lack of mega representation and Vina's event chances hinge almost solely on Discovery. Her traits don't inspire for future event considerations (as the Romantic trait tally balloons), leaving her voyage work and a big empty-calorie base as her usable elements if the Disco train leaves the station.

Vina adorably bests New Eden Pike for the top Disco DIP spot and continues the long held tradition of immediately power creeping crew you just worked/paid for. The raw numbers are there in more than one area, but if your name is Devinoni and you're looking for an edge, this crew doesn't quite fit the bill. Despite the above panning, Vina's stats are significant enough to garner shuttle and voyage work on any roster and a splash of MED is something we rarely pass on, especially if you weren't playing during the former MED/DIP megas. She may shrivel up if Discovery events do too, but as of now she's a strong voyager with bursts of weekend impact.
