Well-statted, but wholly uninteresting, Vina is the type of crew who pushes other, more notable names (Bartender Guinan [voyage], Zhian'tara Odo [base]) down the ranks without you noticing. That sort of company alone makes her a crew worth considering, but like Plomeek night at Tuvok's house, you might leave hungry. DIP is, frankly, too easy to acquire despite its lack of mega representation and Vina's skill set is as common as it gets for a crew with MED. Her traits don't inspire for future event considerations (as the Romantic trait tally balloons), leaving the Disco bubble/freight train as the sole means of pushing her huge DIP base into weekend service.

Vina adorably bests New Eden Pike for the top Disco DIP spot and continues the long held tradition of immediately power creeping crew you just worked/paid for, but that's her most notable attribute. If your name is Devinoni and you're looking for an edge, this crew doesn't quite fit the bill. But despite the above panning, Vina's stats are significant enough to garner shuttle and voyage work on any roster and a splash of MED is something we rarely pass on, especially if you weren't playing during the former MED/DIP megas. A strong and relevant crew in the current game's landscape may shrivel up if Discovery events do too.
