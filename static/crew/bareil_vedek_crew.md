Without collections or consistent events, [_the Vicar_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INJSkcRnRXg&t=74) is handicapped from the start. Luckily, he brings worthwhile voyage credentials; a strong stat total and helpful CMD/MED stack. Only one crew above him in voyage total (Tourist Quark) contributes both skills, but in a lesser amount. His other notable perk is in the arena where a long-duration chunk of crit rating is available at 3 seconds.
