I don't rate Rare crewmembers this low, but ye gods, Jake is dire. Ignore his #8 base stat. You only should consider it if he's the only Diplomat in your manifest. His single stat makes him the single worst 3* Voyager, even being beaten by Maquis Chakotay...a Common Card. You want to know his good points, well tough, he doesn't have any. Trade him in for honor, then spend that honor on trainers for your other crew. If you keep him, cite him and immortalise him then I'm going to have to ask you to stop playing this game now...
