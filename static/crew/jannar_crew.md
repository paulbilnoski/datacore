One of the few voyage exclusive crew that will legitimately make you curse the RNG gods for depriving you of him for so long. Netting you +1 Vanity and +1 Diplomat would be good enough reason to take even a weak card, but Jannar may well find himself carving out quite a niche in your roster. He brings with him a very Xindi instant damage attack (100% base), and a lovely DIP/SCI/ENG skill set that nets a top 10 voyage total, even after 2019's influx of excellent voyagers. His event chances are woeful (1 Xindi), but as daily contributors go, you can't ask for much more.
