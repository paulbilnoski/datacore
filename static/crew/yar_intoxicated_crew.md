If you ever find yourself in the ancient library of Timelines, walk past the "And" bug section, take a left at One Zero Zero One, and in the D section for Drama, you'll find the tale of Polywater Yar. Once upon a time, she had a ship ability to rival the Gods. But the second she was no longer for sale, ~~DB~~ Hades, jealous of her power, nerfed her into oblivion and only an empty husk remains.

Vampire Yar is not quite as lifeless as her art suggests, but it's close. She won't do you any favors on voyages or in the gauntlet, but on ships she's still at least interesting. A two second activation can be worth something to Skirmishers if they have the right complimentary pieces and Yar's event work has been surprisingly solid with five Faction events to date and the #1 Romantic CMD base (C'mon DB, I need that mega!). Not a great choice for new players, but tinkerers with an established roster may want to take a stab at Ms. Dracula.
