[_It's the summer of _](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5YI9ahUgnk)[~~_George_~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5YI9ahUgnk)[_ ENG_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5YI9ahUgnk) at DB headquarters. Six of the top ten ENG crew (that's 60% for you math nerds) are from the last three months and Ms. Brahms â€¦ Sorry, _Mrs._ Brahms is perhaps the least of them. No event or gauntlet work and an [_ENG/SCI skill pair which sits right behind the CMD/DIP/SEC trio_](undefined) for availability. You can count on one hand the number of crew who match her arena evasion, but only if you run a ship with position and are still alive to activate it. In terms of raw power, her base and voyage numbers will serve most rosters just fine thanks to good ol' fashioned power creep, but she's not special in any area and her lack of events or any unique offerings make her more of a collector's piece. When spinning the weekday six pack wheel of doom, look for a crew with more staying power than what Brahms offers.
