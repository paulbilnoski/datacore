Ye Olde Dukat is a collector's piece. Two-skillers are not worthy voyagers in the majority of situations, meaning they have to bring it elsewhere. Unfortunately, Freddy falls short across the board. His lone notable attribute, a good shuttle pair, is missing its dance partner; events. This leaves him mopping up in some daily shuttle duty where, if you don't worship at [_the church of Our Lady of Tanked Shuttles_](https://old.reddit.com/r/StarTrekTimelines/comments/aq5qzg/guide_tanked_shuttles_why_and_how/), he might bump up your success rate by a few percent. With one of his mega punch cards used up, 'Gambler' is his only shot at future relevance.
