Being a Worf will only get a fella so far. Scarlett has certain fringe offerings in the gauntlet and arena and you may see more of him than you otherwise would since a copy was given to players for free, but upgrades to his talents can be found semi-regularly through events. Adding stars won't bring a strong return on investment, even considering Worf's potent event count.
