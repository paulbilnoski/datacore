Welcome to _Star Trek Timelines_, where the points are made up and the traits don't matter - or just don't make sense. Despite being on Section 31 business at the time, he doesn't count for either that faction or as an undercover operative, which is something of a shame. That being said, MED/SCI voyager with a decent event count and the usual dual Bashir collections is still an extensive portfolio. For early to mid game rosters, for whom this combination of skills is a little rarer, he's going to be extremely valuable, and likely to be phased out only by 5* crew - and even then, 'phased out' means he's still going to be thawed on a semi-regular basis for event work.
