The best 1* MED crew in the game with the lowest DIP stat in the game. Worth having about to get through some early MED nodes ,and midweek cadet missions. If you want a good combination of 1* crew look no further than the duo of Tarses and Troi. Each complimenting what the other lacks in DIP and MED. Ship ability fairly average but fills out the Romulan collection. Worth immortalising then freezing once better crew come round.
