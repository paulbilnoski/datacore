A shade weaker than the average new event crew, a good deal of Qorbin's future value will depend on whether or not de Lancie's biannual events get extended to the whole Q family. If not, speculation about event futures of the three-traited man is pointless. Q2 attempts to atone for the lack of voyage traits with a skill order that's not particularly common, even if the overall skill set is held down by two previous mega crew and a gauntlet exclusive. And in the gauntlet, his two weak pairs may disappear from the rankings before the ink dries on this note. He'll perform fine for daily work, as most all new crew do, but has almost no chance for significant impact beyond his debut mega month.
