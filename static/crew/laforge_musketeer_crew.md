A complete crew from top to bottom. Double 1k bases complement the coveted blend of "bridge crew" events + racial (Hologram) trait for weekend impact throughout the year. Day to day, he's just as valuable by contributing very usable SEC and SEC/ENG numbers on voyages. Although he doesn't make too many gauntlet "best of" lists, a top 10 SEC roll gives him a ranked pair to make him at least serviceable there and is a big boon for new players. His double collections aren't the hardest to finish, but finding two in one crew who's worthy of citations is rare.
