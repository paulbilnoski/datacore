Traits (including Disco) have pushed L'Rell well into double digit bonuses within a relatively short time which has given two 1k bases several chances to shine. But like a very similar crew, Torchbearer Rejac, it's difficult to count on future value based on trait bonuses that may vanish as the crew pool grows. Considering DB's Disco love affair, there's a good chance that her two usable bases will continue to find work in the (near) future, but don't count on her contributing much day to day.
