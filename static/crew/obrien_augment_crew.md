A fairly well-rounded 2-skiller. His proficiency pair is #1 in the gauntlet and he has two usable bases for event work. Non-Jury Rigger collections generally aren't a consideration for legendary crew, but finding three in one package is still a nice perk. Q2 2019 flooded the landscape with SEC/ENG voyagers, all but eliminating O'Brien's possibilities there, despite numbers that are strong for a 2-skiller. Missing a third skill is the only thing keeping O'Brien from vaulting up the ranks.
