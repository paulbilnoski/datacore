Big voyage numbers and [_a catchphrase_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoxHjOTqp3A&t=90) are not a worthwhile payout for an extremely expensive build of 100+ faction items and several 4* components. With a hologram mega in the rear view mirror, his return on investment just walked off the holodeck and disappeared into thin air.
