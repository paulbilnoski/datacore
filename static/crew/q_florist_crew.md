One of the top choices for DIP crew makes Q a top contender for Sunday cadet missions and node hunting. Might have some tertiary use on Voyages and if you have a ship with the position ability, consider pairing him up with it to increase damage dealt. Regardless of his lack of extra collections Q makes a strong choice to fill out your DIP crew.
