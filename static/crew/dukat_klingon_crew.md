#1 CMD score for all 3* crew is seriously impressive. Not just that he works on Sundays and can deal 400% damage on cloaking vessels. His dual identity as both Cardassian and Klingon will net him some early Gauntlet use and sports two additional collection bonuses when immortalised. Bearing in mind all that he also does well voyaging, this easily makes him one of the best cards to have in the early game. He is a better Klingon card than some of the actual Klingons.
