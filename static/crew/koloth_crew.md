A good perfectly average voyaging crewman. #18 DIP base and #17 CMD won't get you far unlocking nodes or hitting cadet targets but it will significantly boost your voyaging times. Hull repair when cloaking is a useful mix and a hit on the Diplomat collection might just unlock some rewards. But his common pairing of skills and limited use outside of voyages means he will be easily replaced later down the line.
