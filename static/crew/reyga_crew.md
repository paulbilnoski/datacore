Strong SCI crew are quite common in the rare leagues but this Ferengi makes a worthy contender. #2 SCI base is a strong start and will certainly do well in the Sunday cadet missions. His poor DIP score however means not much use voyaging and of course being Ferengi be prepared to hit up the faction shop many times. Still worth investing into as he will hit both the Ferengi and Innovator collections.
