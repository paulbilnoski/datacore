Good ol' Noggles here is, much like the character he represents, a card with [_hidden depths_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fuzh6RT0wx8). On the surface, he's infrequent event crew more suited for daily shuttles than he is anything else, with a decent-but-not great 6 second +7 Accuracy boost in the Arena, but if you take the time to work those locks and really study the contents, you'll see a hidden value here. This particular Nog, is the singular Ferengi in the game with SCI. No, I don't count Dr. Reyga, thank you. [_His work on metaphasic shielding has been discredited by the scientific community_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnMgD7Igs58). Okay, fine, only 4* and above Ferengi with SCI. Now, on the surface of things, that may not seem like much, but [_you gotta have faith_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLs4MGTTXRU) in the [_Great Material Continuum_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6QVPbD9rD8). A Ferengi mega feels like it's been in the offing for a while now, and to have the entire market cornered on a skill, well. It's a lot more than a lot of 4* crew can offer, I can tell you that. He may not set the world on fire, but he's certainly unique, and sometimes, that's all it takes.
