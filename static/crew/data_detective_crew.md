I'm reminded of a Tolian Soran quote, "Aren't you beginning to feel time gaining on you? It's like a predator. It's stalking you." As Detective ages, his torturous equipping cost becomes less palatable. Nevertheless, we rarely cast aside SEC/SCI crew, let alone those with the massive event count that Data owns. His SEC base is still tops for those events and only a half dozen SEC/SCI crew can best his voyage total, which helps him secure a seat far more often than an equivalent CMD/DIP/SEC. Few others can unlock [_the Investigator/SEC story node_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Rabid_Fans), including former mega crew Thrax.
