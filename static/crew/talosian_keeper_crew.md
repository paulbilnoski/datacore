This walking piece of Trek history takes a different path to relevancy than most of the base/event crew, but is a powerhouse in his/her own right. One of four SCI/MED options in the top 100 voyage crew, he/she adds a super useful CMD tertiary to help snag seats on all sorts of voyage combinations, both because of lack of competition and on the merit of his/her great stat totals. In the gauntlet, he/she owns the #2 SCI roll and SCI/MED ranked pair with a handful of crit traits. A statistically unique crew which any roster should have no trouble utilizing.
