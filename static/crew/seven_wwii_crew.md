Don't let Mrs. Gangster Spock's numbers fool you. Where rare skill set meets gauntlet power, there's always going to be some value to be had. On voyages, a SEC/SCI crew with a couple stars under their belt will surely find a home due to a lack of competition. In the gauntlet, she still owns three ranked pairs, despite several late-2018 additions as competition, and will likely be fine there until at least the next mid-2019 portal update.

Perhaps the most surprising attribute from the Blonde Borg Bombshell is a base SEC which, despite its overall rank, is variant-best and one of the strongest bases among Sevens. Her event frequency since her first feature in mid-2017 has actually been respectable. And to round her out, arena accuracy at four seconds with healthy crit values are useful, especially for Skirmishes. A more valuable crew than the por numbers intimate.
