For a character with so much personality they don't even have a name, [_the Prisoner_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0rio3IPXXU) is a bit of an odd duck, all told. His event count is inflated by two ultimately random trait megas, and with only Tholian and Mirror left over, you're going to have to rely on DB's love of the Mirror Universe to get any event mileage out of him. That being said, that's more than a lot of worse crew have going for them, and Tholian falls squarely in the good category thanks to a healthy SCI/ENG/SEC combo that's going to stay relevant on voyages for a while thanks to decent bases. Unlikely to be thawed very often, if at all, once you outgrow that usefulness.
