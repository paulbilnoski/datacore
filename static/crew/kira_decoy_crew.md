Don't get distracted, let's cut to the chase. We know what to expect with Kira variants; some combination of CMD/DIP/SEC and a steady event count, and, despite the name, Decoy is mostly the real deal. She parlays her strong base and #3 SEC/DIP Voyage pair into a card that is certainly worthy of daily use, though an extremely common skill set and paltry four traits hold her back from being truly elite. Her variant-best DIP and #3 SEC among Kiras also promise to keep her working for the weekend, and if/when a Romantic or Costumed mega rolls around, she will find herself sitting pretty as a great option there as well. She offers little elsewhere outside of a potential future Badda Bing/Vic Fontaine vanity collection, but what's here adds up to a crew that will never let your eyes wander too far away for too long.
