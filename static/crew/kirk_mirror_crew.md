I'm not as hard on Mirror Kirk as many players. No, he's not suitable for daily use, but an impressive event count and #2/3 bases among variants means that when his number is called (every few months), he'll perform fine. That's not the sort of contribution you'd want from a legendary behold, but it's better than a handful of others can offer.
