This Kirk is a [_Ron Popeil special_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLq27iOW0R0) - just freeze and forget. You shouldn't have any need for him during the week, but Kirk event bonuses will always be in fashion and a Villain mega should surprise no one. [_They didn't even use the right picture for his art_](http://tos.trekcore.com/hd/albums/1x05hd/theenemywithinhd410.jpg), but maybe they'll make it up to us with a fusion version down the line.
