For those of you who haven't been keeping score, CMD/SEC is the single most common skill pairing across all crew. It's a niche that isn't so much a niche as it is a gaping chasm into which crew are either flung if they don't stand out, or claw their way back up if they have something else to offer. The Timelines version of the Spartan agoge, if you will. Well, this particular Kirk isn't going to claw his way anywhere in a hurry. He may offer a top 25 base SEC, but outside of Kirk's semi-regular Faction event shuttles, he's going to be seeing his way to your freezer very, very soon. They didn't even use the right picture for his art!
