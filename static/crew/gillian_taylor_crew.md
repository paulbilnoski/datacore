[_Wholly uneventable traits_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Category:Cetacean_Biologist) shift the burden of value to daily use where Kirk's fling delivers, more often than not. Quick arena evasion in a hefty amount, a nice SCI/MED voyage stack, and a huge gauntlet pair by super rare standards even appears in the overall rankings. If you're still in the early game and looking for a collection piece to level, Taylor may be worth it, even without all four stars.
