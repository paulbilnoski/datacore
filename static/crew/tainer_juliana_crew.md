What you see is what you get with Tainer. No waiting around for an event to give her relevance every six months or a 1/25th share in a collection. She's simply a great crew in every phase of daily use and a name who will come up all the time. This wouldn't be the Big (long ass) Book if I didn't mention that she has qualified for three events previously and her bases among Android crew would be exceptional for events, but that's more of a pipe dream, even considering everybody's fondness for Data.

If we follow the trail of stat breadcrumbs; Shuttles - Elite. Better than everybody's Surak or da Vinci. Voyages - Elite. SCI/MED isn't brimming with options which is evidenced by the number of folks using the 2-skill Culber on their runs, even as great as he is elsewhere. Tainer nearly matches his contributions in that combo while adding a chunk of 700 extra stats on top. In the land of coin flips, Tainer leverages two top 20 rolls and a top 20 proficiency total into the #3 SCI/MED pair. It's a shame she can't claim a huge single roll to help her excel in a specific area, but is overall more than serviceable and a great rotational piece with crit-catching traits.
