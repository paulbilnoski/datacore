Weirdly the early game Doctors in this game have a hard time with stats. For a single skill crew her MED stat is the lowest for a 2* crew member. Her base stats fall short of Nurse Kes and her maximum doesn't quite keep up with Nurse Paris which to me is bizarre. However for new players she still has a significant medical usage, especially on mission nodes and cadet missions. Seeing as MED is limited in the early game it's worth keeping her alongside her 2* colleagues.
