Benny's #1 variant SCI and DIP bases paired with a healthy event count comprise the bulk of his value. Unlike certain rare skill combos, a SCI/DIP voyage total is a fairly accurate one where you're likely to have some capable options, especially if you were around for Surak. Speaking of whom, Surak dominates Benny's one ranked pair in the gauntlet as well. He's a rotational option for new rosters who should quickly fall out of favor, but adds a bit of daily use value. As they say, 'black don't crack' and after two and a half years, Benny is still capable of helping you win weekends, even if he lacks pop elsewhere.
