He offers more than previous rankings have given him credit for, but all of it is a hair under good. His gauntlet pair has been buried under walls of Surak and Armus, his instant damage is strong in the arena, but twice as slow as the crew you really want there, his collection is a vanity one, and his event work is spotty at best, despite a late 2018 mega. I've been slowly convincing myself that the Villain trait will make certain cards relevant in the future, but even without another mega, Proton's arch nemesis can occasionally flash usefulness for younger rosters.
