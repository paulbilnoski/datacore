Now this is a proper working card, well for a 1* common card. She can fill two collections, one of which is the hard-to-fill Jury Rigger. She is the top Engineer in the common collection and comes with a fair amount of useful traits including Cyberneticist. She can work in all three of the week-day cadet missions and her ship ability will certainly poke a few holes in enemy vessels. Whilst she's not going to be securing lengthy voyages for you or give a sizable increase in your shuttles, she certainly is one of the best performing common cards.
