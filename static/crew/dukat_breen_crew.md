It's always nice when a handsome card has the goods to backup the looks, and Breen Dukat just about does. Dual collections make him worth your time, and Dukat + trait events will keep him just about relevant. [_Not as big of a pain in the ass as Kira would have you think._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrbo39Lw-r4)
