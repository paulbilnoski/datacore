It's always nice when a handsome card has the goods to backup the looks, and Breen Dukat just about does. Dual collections make him worth your time, and his best (trait) event days may be ahead of him. Not much daily value, but unlocks a lot of value when fully fused - [_not as big of a pain in the ass as Kira would have you think._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrbo39Lw-r4)
