All-Terrain Burnham is her first gauntleteer variant and helps flesh out a well-rounded STT character. She parlays a top five SEC proficiency into two #3 ranked gauntlet pairs; both close enough to catch #1 sleeping if she brings a crit advantage. Despite numbers heavily tilted toward proficiencies, her SEC base is tops for a character who's always a threat to pick up fistfuls of events. Adequate voyage numbers paired with a skill set on the uncommon side makes her the #3 SEC/SCI voyager in the game, behind only the esteemed Gary Seven and Gladiator Spock. First Officer Burnham may hog the headlines, but the ATB can take you anywhere you want to go.
