Welcome to Le Cur de Lion. She's Katrine. And arguably better than [_Katrine v.1_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Agent_Janeway). No longer the best option for Janeway CMD, she does still offer the _second_ best base, which may again be an asset with Groundhog Janeway making her first event appearance in 2019 after a 14 month winter. Katrine's voyage work isn't particularly special, even with a splash of SCI, but in combination with her theoretical event value, she's at least an average crew. With thin, but possible use elsewhere, she's not quite a jack of all trades, but perhaps a 9 or 10 of all trades.
