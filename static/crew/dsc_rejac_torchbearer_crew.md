There's a basement level of usefulness for Discovery crew and this is it. Events aside, the [_Fonzie_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQc9L2RbQkw) card art is the best thing about Rejac. He's unlikely to contribute day to day without several stars and his event opportunities rest on something of a bubble at this point. Klingon and Disco have combined forhuge swaths of bonuses already, but who can say how many more they'll trigger? A formerly ranked gauntlet pair with the occasional 65% crit might rarely make him a fifth member of your gauntlet squad, but that's hardly worth spending a behold on.
