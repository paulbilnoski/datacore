[_I had to zoom out_](https://i.imgur.com/6WbvSui.png) just to screenshot her competition for base CMD; you may even notice a few 5/5s in there whose primary she bests. Surprisingly, she's not the top CMD voyager, but having the only secondary-or-better MED in the top 80 CMD means she fills that particular niche wonderfully with solid totals to boot. Her daily work is among the best in the game, but she's essentially a non-event crew with no collections which dampens her desirability a bit. Thankfully, her lone event was alongside the popular Killy in a faction event which should be ripe for a re-run, perhaps in 2019.
