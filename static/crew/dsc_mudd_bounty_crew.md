For those keeping up with regular events, Mudd is somewhat similar to the previous week's reward Ba'ul. Unfortunately for ol' Harcourt, his voyage effectiveness is a bit wanting for a new face. In fact, as the ninth SEC/ENG crew of 2019 (Hell, he's not even [_the first one released this week_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Tribble_Herder_Scotty)) and lagging behind all of the others in voyage power, he may not be much of an upgrade there for players who stay current, despite being a competent voyager in a vacuum.

More likely to be of use are bases currently ranked third and sixth among Disco crew; a pool that's growing larger by the day, but is still an event juggernaut. An interesting trait set may provide further value to a card who doesn't offer much beyond the standard base and voyage considerations.
