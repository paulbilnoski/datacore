His stats and collection are both inspiring. Double digit events to pair with a top SEC base that's elite (no, seriously, it's 1337). His 85% Faction event rate means that when his event number is called, he will contribute almost without exception, especially considering he's the #1 "SEC and DIP" shuttler in the game. With huge voyage SEC and a stat total ahead of a couple 3-skill crew, he has a chance to catch a ride there too, depending on your situation.

Even better is his shipboard potential. A Skirmish anchor who can cut your battles down to six seconds with the right complimentary crew is invaluable. 500% is the highest that instant damage gets and most other damage crew are +Attack or Evasion. The caveat is a cloak trigger that you'll need to scrape together schematics for from the Dabo wheel or packs, but his ability is worth the extra effort. His first sta,r is important to grab for his ship ability and can save you hours of gameplay over time.
