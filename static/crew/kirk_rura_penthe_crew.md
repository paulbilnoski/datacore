His stats and collection are both inspiring. Double digit events to pair with a top SEC base that's elite (no, seriously, it's 1337). Kirk's 85% Faction event rate means that when his event number is called, he will contribute almost without exception, especially considering he's the #1 "SEC and DIP" shuttler in the game. With huge voyage SEC and a stat total ahead of a couple 3-skill crew, he has a chance to catch a ride there too, depending on your situation.

Even better is his shipboard potential. A Skirmish anchor who can cut your battles down to six seconds with the right complimentary crew is invaluable. 500% is the highest that instant damage gets and most other damage crew are +Attack or Evasion. The caveat is a cloak trigger that you'll need to scrape together schematics for from the Dabo wheel or packs, but his ability is worth the extra effort. His first sta,r is important to grab for his ship ability and can save you hours of gameplay over time.

Wrathful Kirk is introduced as a superior SEC option for Kirk events and is more likely to be owned than the poorly statted Kal-if-fee or Mirror variants. Q2 2019 added two quick and triggerless shipboard damage options in Rura Penthe Commandant and Fury Kes. With more competition in his wheelhouse, RP Kirk's lack of voyage ability becomes more of a factor.
