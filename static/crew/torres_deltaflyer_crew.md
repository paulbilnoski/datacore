Much like Human Torres is essentially a copy of the Rozhenkos, the soon-to-be Mrs. Paris (or is he Mr. Torres?) is a near-duplicate of Conditioned La Forge, swapping his tertiary DIP for CMD in another example of power creep done right. This works very much in her and our favor, and adds another rock-solid ENG/SEC voyager to the ranks. Her two variant-best bases and #1 Klingon ENG will ensure her some weekend duty, though it's important to note her event count is inflated by a long-gone Pilot mega and a Klingon trait that doesn't get its named called with nearly the frequency it used to. A prohibitive accuracy handicap will keep her off your ships, and she's a zero in the Gauntlet, but she still rates as a useful daily contributor that turns into a must-have for 2-3 weekends a year.
