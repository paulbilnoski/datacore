One of his Borg implants must contain a swiss army knife. He's no longer [_the best of the best_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXRi28W-ENY&t=39) at anything, but still strong in many areas. A competent base/event pairing with great voyage credentials and a strong ENG/CMD pair in the gauntlet where he hits 65% crit often enough. Double stat-boosting collections are the cherry on top. Resisting him in a behold would be futile.
