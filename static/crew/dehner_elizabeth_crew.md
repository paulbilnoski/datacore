[_Dehner Dehner Dehner Dehner Batman!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSaDPc1Cs5U) I hate to be negative about such an iconic character, but there's not enough meat here for a compliment sandwich. Her MED base is about as deceiving as it can be. It sits behind three former Mega crew as well as the Ã¼ber popular Culber and is the least common Faction event skill. Her introductory weekend is one of two that she's been bonus-eligible for since the beginning of Timelines. Due to the rarity of MED primaries, she's far from the worst crew and will contribute on most rosters (especially new players), just don't chase her big base expecting it to carry much value.
