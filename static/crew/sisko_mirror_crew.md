The universe has a cruel sense of humor to give so many events to the likes of this guy. Sisko's bases are a joke and his untapped traits may have bonus pools that are too large for future mega consideration, leaving his value to limp along on variant events only. It's hard to ignore the sheer number of events he's qualified for so far, but that pace is likely to slow significantly moving forward.
