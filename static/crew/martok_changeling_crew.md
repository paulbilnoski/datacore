No one is particularly excited to see Changeling Martok, which is totally understandable, but he can be plugged in for some daily work thanks to a top five gauntlet pair that's competitive against everyone not named Locutus or Gowron and average voyage numbers. On the weekend he's collected a formidable number of bonuses which should at least merit behold consideration against the plethora of one-hit wonders floating around. Average in every corner except events, Martok's prospects are as attractive as the character himself, but is still better value than loads of other non-starters.
