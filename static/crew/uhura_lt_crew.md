A brand new Uhura, and almost certainly her best variant, released just a few days after the end of an Uhura event - clever marketing, or slightly silly? You decide! DB may be making an effort to fill out the more barren skill combinations these days, but make no mistake, CMD/DIP/SEC voyagers are ten a penny and age like unpasteurised milk. It'd be one thing if she came with some kind of silver bullet - an aces Gauntlet pair, for example, or killer Arena stats. But no, she's as vanilla as she comes, with fewer bells and whistles than her Gunslinger counterpart, despite having the overall statistical advantage. 

That being said, it is a  _sizeable_  statistical advantage, and it comes with a fantastic fro, if little else. If you have a particular affection for her character or  _The Slow Motion Picture_, or just need a particularly strong CMD base that can handle voyages and shuttles, then she'll serve you extremely well. And for those rare Uhura events, she's  _the_  variant to own. Just don't expect her value to go anywhere but down, because this particular crew's boogeyman is age, events, replaceability. . . just about KC and the whole goddamn Sunshine Band.
