A brand new Uhura, and almost certainly her best variant, released just a few days after the end of an Uhura event - clever marketing, or slightly silly? You decide! Releasing a CMD/DIP/SEC voyager with slightly worse stats than Quinn, who you can snag two copies of for free from episode 10, with barely better event chances and no eventable traits - an indicator of how well this particular card is going to age, or more than a little redundant? You also decide!

It'd be one thing if she came with some kind of silver bullet - an aces Gauntlet pair, for example, or killer Arena stats. But no, she's as vanilla as she comes, with fewer bells and whistles than her Gunslinger counterpart, despite having the overall statistical advantage. If you have a particular affection for her character or  _The Slow Motion Picture_, or just need a particularly strong CMD base that can handle voyages and shuttles, then she'll serve you well. Just don't expect her value to go anywhere but down, because this particular crewman's statistical boogeyman is KC and the whole goddamn Sunshine Band.
