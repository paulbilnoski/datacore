Similar to Ambassador Fox this Diplomat has a respectable DIP stat and if you are still struggling on a Sunday he might be of some use. However unlike A-Fox he strangely doesn't fill the Diplomat collection. Now...how much do you like transporter fused abominations, because a combination of this Neelix and Security Chief Tuvok can make the, well, frankly uninspiring 4* Tuvix. But seeing as Ambassador Neelix doesn't fulfill any other collection than Rare, then you might as well fuse up. Just remember, fully equip to level 99 (not 100) THEN fuse.
