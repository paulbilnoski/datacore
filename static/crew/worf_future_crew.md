From the creators of Kahless the Expensive comes Governor Worf. He's literally a carbon copy on voyages; all three skills and overall total within single digit points of each other. It's fair to worry about CMD/DIP/SEC's longevity in the face of power creep, but Kahless has hung on among the elite for almost two years so let's hope that similarity carries over too. From there their paths diverge - Kahless to the land of dice rolls and Worf to weekend warrior. Governor's huge CMD score is more than suitable for daily shuttles and though he doesn't have many eventable traits to prop up his bonus count, Worf + Klingon is far better than most crew get. His only other peripheral perk is a hardy +11 arena attack that comes online quickly enough if you can meet the trigger requirement.
