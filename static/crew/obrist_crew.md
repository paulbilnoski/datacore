I'll take "Decent Non-Event Crew" for $800, Alex. Obrist may be champion of Quiz Bowl, but once his Mega-moment passes, so does a lot of his value to veteran players. That does not mean he's worthless, as his raw numbers tell the tale of a solid contributor, and SCI/COM voyagers are fairly rare at his power level (two in the top 80). His Arena skills are decent too, if a bit slow, with a useful +9 accuracy boost at 10 seconds. Beyond that, we're looking at a row of zeroes for Gauntlet, Events, and Collections.
