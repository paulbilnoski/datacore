Consistently inconsistent, McCoy has multiple events in each calendar year, but only three with a Faction component. If you go to the trouble of snagging this voyage exclusive from a three part dilemma, the odds are you won't still need to finish his Physician collection leaving just some irregular event work in his wake.
