A one skilled minor MACO does not make a voyaging man happy. The 3rd worst 3* Voyager mostly due to her one skilled SEC stat. That SEC stat is strong mind you and useful for some missions on the Saturday cadets. However that alone doesn't warrant spending time on her unless you want to fill out some more slots on the Veteran collection.
