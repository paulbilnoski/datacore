[_I'll just put this here._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfF4Jq478_s) The beard, the lean, the grin. No one can resist the Riker charm and he certainly deserves more events. As for the card; formerly top shelf voyage stats are drooping, but remain good enough for daily voyage work with the odd weekend chip-in thanks to his #1 variant CMD.
