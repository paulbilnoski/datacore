I'll just put this here. The beard, the lean, the grin. No one can resist the Riker charm and he certainly deserves more events. As for the card; formerly top shelf voyage stats are drooping, but remain good enough for daily voyage work with the odd weekend chip-in thanks to his #1 variant CMD. Someone pm me on the day I need to edit in his Age of Sail collection.
