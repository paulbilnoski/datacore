The best 4* Spock by a country mile, and that would be even without his added event potential as a Discovery variant - a stellar SCI base, and a lovely SCI/SEC pairing makes this pack-only Vulcanian rather more tempting than some more recent offerings (*cough* Bynars *cough*). One newer super rare has topped his SEC/SCI voyage contributions, but the next best option for this particular set of skills is Blood Oath Dax almost 100 ranks lower. There's no smoking gun here; just another SCI heavy Discovery toon with handsome voyage prospects and weekend use out the wazoo. Live long and suck it, Ambassador and Kal-if-fee!
