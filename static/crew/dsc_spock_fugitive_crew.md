The best 4* Spock by a country mile, and that would be even without his added event potential as a Discovery variant - a stellar SCI base, and a lovely SCI/SEC pairing makes this pack-only Vulcanian rather more tempting than some more recent offerings (*cough* Bynars *cough*). One newer super rare has topped his SEC/SCI voyage contributions, but the next best option for this [_particular set of skills_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZOywn1qArI) is Blood Oath Dax almost 100 ranks lower. There's no smoking gun here; just another SCI heavy Discovery toon with handsome voyage prospects and weekend use out the wazoo. [_Live long and suck it_](https://youtu.be/BJnRJvTx4uQ?t=60), Ambassador and Kal-if-fee!
