Mr Odo Exposition here has some quite impressive stats. #6 MED base and #20 SCI base alongside participation in the Sunday cadet events definitely give Pol some legs. He has quite a high voyage rank too that is if you are not already swimming in SCI crew already, although SCI/MED is not a common pairing in the 3* leagues. No additional collection however but his ship ability gives a nice evasion boost should you need it.
