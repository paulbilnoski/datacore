Debate the vedek. Always, always choose to debate the vedek. Why? Because he's your best shot at landing one of the few truly good crew that come only from voyages. Sporting a top 10 base SEC, even now, a year and a half on, the Clown brings a meaty secondary ENG (not a common combination) and a smattering of traits just brimming with potential (Villain mega?) to bear, handing you a top 25 voyager. In the arena, he flexes his muscles as one of the premier defensive options. A fat stack of evasion and shield repair is available early enough to thwart almost any incoming damage. He may squarely be daily use crew, but what a wonderful daily use crew.

With the Krayton generating buzz for its ability to burst damage at four seconds and new hard-hitting RP Commandant popping up, you might need faster than ever evasion crew for the Admiral division. The premier options are Laborer Spock, Minuet, and The Clown with Admiral Janeway, Judge Q, Romulan Picard, and Formal Dress Wes close behind. Other four second names include Ambassador Soval, Vedek Bareil Antos, Lore, Scientist Degra, RAF Julian Bashir, Interfaced Barclay, Nyota Uhura, Prospero Data, Defensive Phlox, Katra McCoy, Kai Opaka, Wedding Dress T'Pol, The Prophet, The Keeper (Crit bonus), White Rabbit, Yelgrun, Armed Philippa Georgiou, Captain Q, Commander Barclay, Captain Beverly Picard, and Alan-A-Dale.
