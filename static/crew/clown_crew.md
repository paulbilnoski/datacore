Debate the vedek. Always, always choose to debate the vedek. Why? Because he's your best shot at landing one of the few truly good crew that come only from voyages. Sporting a top 10 base SEC, even now, a year and a half on, the Clown brings a meaty secondary ENG (not a common combination) and a smattering of traits just brimming with potential (Villain mega?) to bear, handing you a top 25 voyager. In the arena, he flexes his muscles as one of the premier defensive options. A fat stack of evasion and shield repair is available early enough to thwart almost any incoming damage. He may squarely be daily use crew, but what a wonderful daily use crew.
