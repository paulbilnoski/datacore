Debate the vedek. Always, always choose to debate the vedek. Why? Because it's the only way you're landing one of the best voyage exclusives. Sporting a top five base SEC, even now, a year and a half on, the Clown brings a meaty secondary ENG and a smattering of traits just brimming with potential (Villain mega?) to bear, handing you voyage power worth considering. In the arena, he flexes his muscles as one of the premier defensive options. A fat stack of evasion and shield repair is available early enough to thwart almost any incoming damage. He may squarely be daily use crew, but what a wonderful daily use crew.
