This crew has me as flabbergasted as Solbor was by Winn's cozying up to an undercover Dukat. Somehow he's garnered five past event bonuses from three esoteric traits; I guess you _can _squeeze water from a stone. The craziest part is, he'll probably pop back up for a month down the line as the current top Bajoran super rare DIP. Solbor is as freeze-and-forget as they come and may not even be worth a behold for non-collectors, even if his marginal trait set yields a sliver of future event potential.
