I'm going to tell you a story. Just last year, during the Hologram mega, I started a second account at the worst time. A more motley lineup of event crew you've never seen; Minuet, Wedding Day Quark, Michael Sullivan, and Captain John Harriman. Po might actually be better than all of them combined. Boy, I wish I had her as my starting crew instead and if [_you've just joined us_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m5PfKTwMFY), you picked the right time.

From top to bottom, Runaway excels and hits several elite high spots. A great event/base pairing as the top Discovery super rare ENG meets two stat-boosting collections for post-immortal goodness, but even better may be her voyage work. Po slots in as the top ENG/DIP voyager (one of only two in the top 120) and the only ENG primary among top 30 voyagers. Family runaway or not, Po is one crew you want to welcome with open arms as an immediate and long-term treasure trove. Now read the first word of each sentence.
