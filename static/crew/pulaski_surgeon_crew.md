I'm notoriously tough on non-event 2-skillers which you know Pulaski is when freakin' Chakotay doubles her features. But her MED lead over the former mega Bashir is significant and her total numbers are good enough for some voyage work in a depleted MED/SCI stack. Top MED and SCI/MED crew have some [_serious potential for Faction events_](undefined) - even if Pulaski rarely catches a bonus, she can contribute where it counts.
