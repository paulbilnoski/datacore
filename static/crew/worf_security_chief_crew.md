Are you ready to tackle (most) weekday SEC missions! This is your man. Someone I neglected to my peril as his strong SEC stat will clear all the cadet missions he is eligible for. His CMD stat isn't inspiring so he won't make it on many voyages, his ship ability isn't the best either nor does he fill any additional collections. But if you are still clearing cadet missions get your Worf up!
