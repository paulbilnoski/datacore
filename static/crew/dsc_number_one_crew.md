She's eerily similar to Interfaced La Forge, in case you'd like a more well-known comp. Great base/voyage numbers with a single bullet in her gauntlet gun; a top five ranked pair. Number One is more than serviceable for daily use despite an easy to acquire primary, leaving just the question of events. It's useless to try and put a number on things, but based on past history and DB's infatuation with Di$covery, she's likely to [_"get hers"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5d0KXJMRWQ), whether it be through variant or trait bonuses.
