Upgraded Wesley Crusher isn't too much better than his common counterpart. He has the advantage of the prodigy trait which will help with a few mission nodes but that's about all. Don't bank on him helping too much with cadets, he isn't terrible but there are better crew you can work with. Consider using the upgraded 3* Ensign Crusher for a better Wesley experience.
