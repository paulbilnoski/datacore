Even if you don't have fond mammaries of Phlox, you have to admit his body of work is impressive. The cupboard has long been bare of ENG/MED crew and with a thicc SCI base which nips at the heels of the renowned Surak as well as meaty voyage power, Naked Phlox is an extremely titillating crew. Only one other crew shares his order of skills and though event work may be hard to come by, he outperforms his voyage score and can even pitch in for the odd gauntlet with two low ranked pairs.
