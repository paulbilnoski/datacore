It's no secret that MED/SEC is an uncommon (the fourth rarest, in fact) skill pairing, with the best Super Rare option previously being Mirror Phlox - by all accounts, something of an outlier in his overall versatility. Bashir can't quite match his ability to be the best at everything, but he does have some extremely valuable contributions to make, bringing dual collections to the table (including Engineered, one of the harder collections to finish, and needing every 4* it can get) as well as stats even better than his older two skill RAF brother. Definitely worth pulling a pack or two for, especially if you find yourself in need of MEDical attention.
