Somewhat fittingly, Trader Worf lacks any semblance of power. His bases aren't daily use material, but do match up nicely with a solid Worf/Klingon event count that's well into double-digits. Aside from occasional Faction event help, Trader offers a chunk of attack and crit bonus at six seconds in the arena; fast enough to pair with most damage abilities.
