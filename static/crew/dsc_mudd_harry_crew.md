Dual 1k bases including impressively strong DIP put him near the top tier of shuttle crew, even if some far more popular names sit above him in the ranks. Two of his three previous events occurred during Disco megas and so it would seem that a massive portion of Mudd's power is tied to them. Until they stop, he's a crew you'll want to acquire for potent results weeks at a time. If you need him to pitch in outside of daily shuttles, his +10 attack @ 6 seconds in the arena is a fantastic boost for fast activating crew and can bring even super rare damage options to relevance.
