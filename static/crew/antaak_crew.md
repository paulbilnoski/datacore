One of the few Klingons with SCI and still the only one with MED, which is a double-edged sword as you may not find much MED crafting or shuttle seats in Klingon events. A top 5 MED proficiency roll among 4* crew gives him gauntlet use right from 1/4. [_Unlocks a node_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Bearing_Up) in episode nine.
