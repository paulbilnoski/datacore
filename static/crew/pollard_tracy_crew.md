Doctor Tracy Pollard of "Hugh Culber!...and...a friend." fame has hilariously debuted as the #2 to Culber's #1 base and voyage MED. Apparently Starfleet Medical used to be pretty damn good back in the day before they started pumping out scrubs (hah!) like the genetically engineered super genius Bashir or 'programed with over five million medical procedures' EMH.

Pollard's base and voyage ranks are identical to Dr. Pulaski's (the good one) when she debuted four months ago which quite clearly illustrates the progression of power creep in the game. But that's no knock against Pollard. A base/Disco event pairing is always juicy and her debut marks only the third MED/CMD legendary in the game which assures her voyage work even if the stat total doesn't pop. Her collections are two of the easiest 25-thresholders to complete, but only serve to round out a card who any roster should covet as an immediate impact player.
