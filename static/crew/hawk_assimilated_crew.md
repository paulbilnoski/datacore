Not too long ago, this blurb would have begun with a warning about Borg event chances, but thanks to a 2019 doubleheader and new faction, DB lifted our Collective spirits and gave reminder that the big Borg baddies haven't been forgotten. Excellent news for Hawk who's as monstrous in game as he is on the silver screen.

Double 1k bases aren't quite so rare anymore, but Hawk ups the ante with dual 1100s which are good for the #1 and #3 bases among Borg crew. Events aren't going to be abundant, but with plenty of power for daily shuttles aside, we'll take what we can get. Voyage work is likely to be Hawk's calling card, where a splash of SCI solidifies elite stat ranks to create a facsimile of Mirror Jean-Luc Picard which outdoes the original. If you still need a legendary to finish the Borg collection and Hawk is one of your options, "Make it so".
