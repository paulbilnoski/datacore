He's no dung beetle, in fact Klingon Sisko is pretty far from shit. Stout base and voyage numbers, a very steady event count, and double collections make him almost an ideal crew to pull an event pack for, considering the Skirmish he comes from will have only given you three copies. The skill set, as always, is a mark against him, but with as well as he'll perform elsewhere and his two fistfuls of traits, this is a crew you'll want for the future, even if his collections aren't a big concern for you.
