One of the less "Mega" mega crew in retrospect, at least by the numbers, but still a sturdy card. His SEC sits 4th among Klingon crew, which is his primary event consideration, but may also pick up Hero or Cultural Figure megas down the line. That'll cut it for Faction events and those who have him at 5/5 from his mega will likely tell you he's been manning shuttles for them for a long time. There's been a glut of CMD/DIP/SEC voyagers added lately and so his power has sunk to merely average with a replaceable skill set.

Though there is nothing elite about him, Kortar as a package should still have the potential to outperform many older cards. If he's sitting at 4/5 on your roster from his events, the window on him being a good citation investment has passed; let beholds take care of FFing him and use the honor on one of the many new powerhouses introduced regularly.
