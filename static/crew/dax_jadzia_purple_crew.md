(Cue Theme Song Here) Riker's Angel's (other) Science Specialist. Yes! Eligible for all three cadet missions with a very useful ship ability for those who sport a cloaking vessel. Alongside Sito, Pazlar and Wildman you will have no trouble completing all of the cadet challenges. Outside of that, well she doesn't fill any additional collections but has quite a high SCI stat for an uncommon.
