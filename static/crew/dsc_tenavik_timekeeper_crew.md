There's a young lady...what's her name again? Ah, right, First Officer Burnham. [_You may have heard of her._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hzx8KHjQD6c) Timelord Tenavik does about a 95% approximation of her with [_the first four stars on the house_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd4-UnU8lWY). Unless you're eyeing end-of-mega 390 packs, Tenavik is a day one citation hog as he boasts two top five Discovery/Klingon bases and auto-include voyage power for when the event dust settles (if it ever settles). His arena offering wouldn't be particularly noteworthy on most crew, but for the Skirmish in his introductory mega event, he'll do fine as an early-activating support for your attack boosts and damage dealers.
