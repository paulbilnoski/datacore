It's been a long dark winter for Mr. Scott, but at long last, there's light up ahead. Now, it's important to note a few tribbles - sorry, quibbles - and caveats, but let's just take a moment to bask in that voyage score. Aahhh. All right, so Mr. Scott is a zero in Gauntlet, and he doesn't even have the Captain invisi-trait, so he's qualified for a grand spanking one whole event in the entirety of Timelines history. And you may be feeling cynical about ENG/SEC voyagers now that we've had a rapid influx of them, but make no mistake, Scotty can still hang with the best of them - [_because it's all 'bout that base, 'bout that base, no tribble_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk).

In all seriousness, even if he may not pick up bonuses, he'll still be handy for filling in on shuttles - perhaps you may have even noticed the dearth of Discovery engineers this past week during the Faction event? If you found yourself relying on Determined Janeway to shore up some roster deficiencies, then Scotty will perform in a similar, if not better, fashion for you. And unless you made a dedicated effort to immortalise previous candidates like Irina, the new #1 ENG voyager may be one of the better candidates if you're having tribble nailing down Jury Rigger, one of the more elusive collections ( [_unless you have a particular love for stat dregs like North Star Tucker or Gangster Spock_](https://youtu.be/rxgWHzMvXOY?t=15) ). DB may have been throwing out top ten ENG bases like, well, tribbles, but Scotty's voyage score means he'll age a lot more gracefully than you'd expect. Now, say it with me.  [_I didn't mean to say that Ru'afo should be hauling garbage. . . I meant to say that he should be hauled away AS GARBAGE!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsO-7ENKGP4)
