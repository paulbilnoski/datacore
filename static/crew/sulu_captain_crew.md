Craptain Sulu somehow managed to be featured crew twice without his variants being bonus. The Captain's Oath re-run [_tried to fix that_](https://forum.disruptorbeam.com/stt/discussion/11943/compensation-rewards-for-captain-s-oath-event-11-5), but Sulu's variant event count still sits at two and his daily value is in the tank.
