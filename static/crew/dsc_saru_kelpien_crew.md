Classic DB. There was no way they were going to let [_Runaway Po_](undefined)'s reign as #1 Purple Disco ENG last longer than a hiccup. Since the comparison is recent and hanging low for us already, the collections and ENG base line up, but Saru's voyage efficacy and trait set are steps down.

Still an excellent crew on his own merits, Saru contributes two stat-boosting collections, solid base power, and good-not-great voyage work with ENG/SCI being a very common pairing. Discovery's event eligibility has been the talk around town for most of 2019, but until proven otherwise, it's a plus attribute for crew, provided you're not overloaded with options. With a seemingly uneventable group of traits, you'll be looking for an uptick in variant events if the megas stop. Speculation aside, Saru is the rare collection  [_jewel_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0FVMHJReKk&t=84)  with the daily stats to back it up and certainly worth fusing if your Jury Rigger collection is incomplete.
