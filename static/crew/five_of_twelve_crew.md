There's no need to worry about a top 50-ish voyage crew, as long as their skill set isn't too common. 5 of 12's very nearly is, but a clutch ENG tertiary will slow his descent over time ala Falcon O'Brien or EV Suit Archer. More interesting is a CMD base which beats out the ballyhooed Borg Queen for the #1 Borg CMD, even if only by a bit. And his SECondary is just a few points out of #2 for Borg crew as well. Collections don't usually sway the value of legendary crew much, but hitting two at once that require a gold can be a consideration on certain rosters. The ultimate deep-dive; a possible future variant event for Dream(y) Axum.
