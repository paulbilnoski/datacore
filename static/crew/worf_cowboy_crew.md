Squarely above average, especially for a crew with the most common skill set. Owner of a worthwhile event CMD base and voyage numbers in the top 1/3rd for daily use. Worf's variants have claimed over a dozen events now, traits included, and Sheriff is one of very few crew with a spot in two different vanity collections.
