Coming in with a hair helmet that would make Master Shredder jealous and a catsuit that puts Seven of Nine on notice, Sarah Con-Yar is a victim of bad timing for her skill set. The raw numbers are pretty good, but she comes hot on the heels over several other great SEC/ENG crew that effectively equal her voyage score, but bring more to the table for events, as Yar will need a lucky trait match or a Desperate mega to even get a chance at weekend work. As packbait goes, you could do a lot worse, but in the end, she will probably only break your heart.
