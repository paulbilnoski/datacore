I'm experiencing a bit of nIb'poH - we just had this crew last week and his name then was Human Torres. I recommend reading her note and the Sergey and Helena Rozhenko comparison as it's still relevant. In this case, Trip trades in the useful Jury Rigger trait for Casual (not ideal) and though his primary base is not far off, it's still a sizeable rankings gap which will rear its head for priority shuttle seating against superior and more well-rounded crew. In most scenarios this is a crew whose bases will make a tangible difference twice a year; just often enough to remind you that he's on your roster. The rest of the time it's advisable to seek investment in crew who offer better power or more utility.
