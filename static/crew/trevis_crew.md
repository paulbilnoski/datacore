Trevis and butthead are not the most esteemed names to join the game and their long-term value is [_B-A-D_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsUXAEzaC3Q), but as compensation for players chasing Leonardo or a final star on Minuet in the weekday six pack, they're not the worst. Respectable daily use numbers on shuttles and voyages along with some stopgap arena work comprise the bulk of their value with some stray event considerations thanks to Hologram and Cultural Figure (??) traits. Trevis may snag more shuttle work while Flotter mops up on voyages, but if you're a new player looking for help in what they offer, save your currency for something more concrete than a six pack.
