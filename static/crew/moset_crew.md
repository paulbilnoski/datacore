It's not fair to say Crell isn't event crew. All five of his traits have been event bonuses that have combined for a respectable total and his MED base for those traits ranks 1st/2nd/2nd/4th/10th. That combination of event frequency and efficacy is more potent than many supposed "Bridge crew". Though known as a gauntleteer, his relative power there has dipped tremendously and the best of his three ranked pairs is rated at only 72% of the #1 crew. He still has some value when his traits align, but he's much more of a throw-in as your fifth crew than a powerhouse.

Despite a common-for-MED skill set and drooping totals, his voyage MED is still decent enough to earn work there with the requisite number of stars, especially if you don't have any of the MED mega crew. And in the arena, his massive crit values activate quickly enough to compliment several damage crew while dodging others like the infamous T'Kuvma. Moset is useful from top to bottom and can contribute beyond what his lower stat rankings suggest.
