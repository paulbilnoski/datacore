After being one of the last holdouts for an event feature, the second half of 2018 suddenly brought Archer a double feature, a mega, and [_one more bonus for good measure_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/The_Captain%27s_Oath_2). The sad fact is that Archer will never be a major event player, but recent history and some mega-able traits highlight a CMD base that can still make a difference. His similarly ranked voyage CMD with useful tertiary ENG will grant him voyage opportunities beyond those suggested by a subpar voyage total. Jury Rigger is still a valuable commodity and with Archer's event count finally growing to match his base, he's becoming a more tempting investment for those looking to complete the difficult collection.
