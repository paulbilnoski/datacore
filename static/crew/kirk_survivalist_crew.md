True to his on-screen performance, this Kirk has cobbled together every useful part of a card and created a cannon of a crew. Collection? Check. Multiple ranked Gauntlet pairs, strong skirmish ability, good voyage numbers? Check, check, check. The crafty Kirk has picked the perfect character to be a proficiency crew for because he's the only variant with SCI _or_ ENG. Which means that, barring other featured crew, he'll have a ~400 ENG and ~900 SCI lead over the best non-bonus options for Kirk event shuttles. Great news, since eleven of Kirk's thirteen events have been Factions. If you want to collect the best variant of each character and have your bases covered (pardon the pun) for events, Survivalist Kirk is the easiest choice you can make.
