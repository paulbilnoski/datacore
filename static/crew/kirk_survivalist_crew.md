True to his on-screen performance, this Kirk has cobbled together every useful part of a card and created a cannon of a crew. Collection? Check. Multiple ranked Gauntlet pairs, strong skirmish ability, good voyage numbers? Check, check, check. The crafty Kirk has picked the perfect character to be a proficiency crew for because he's the only variant with SCI _or_ ENG. Which means that, barring other featured crew, he'll have a ~400 ENG and ~900 SCI lead over the best non-bonus options for Kirk event shuttles. Great news, since eleven of Kirk's thirteen events have been Factions. If you want to collect the best variant of each character and have your bases covered (pardon the pun) for events, Survivalist Kirk is the easiest choice you can make.

> This Kirk variant went from green light to red light in the wink of an eye. His strength comes from his exclusivity and flexibility, both of which took a big hit when he was made a global gift. In the gauntlet, your 45% crit Kirk is going to face fewer 5% Sevens of Nine and more mirror matchups. For Kirk events, an 879 SCI lead over the top non-bonus option has dipped to 780 over a 1/5 Survivalist and, as your competitors star him up, brings him closer to Mega crew territory where you're trying to pull even, rather than exploit an edge. His skill set remains strong for voyages with little competition above him, but sinking relative power there and poor bases make this global gift a bit less sweet for those who already owned him.
