Though deserving of more events, [_wishing for a thing does not make it so_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708768/quotes/qt0337838). He offers nothing for your roster aside from the honorific of owning the lowest base of any 4* - 200 DIP. He took lessons from Judge Q and somehow turns a big proficiency total into some mediocre gauntlet pairs.
