Geordi's note on release gushed about his formerly rare ENG/SEC skill set for voyages, but then DB went all [~~_crossfire_~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCwn1NTK-50) rapid fire and blew up that exclusivity. If you missed out on those Q2 2019 crew, you'll still be happy with his services as your other portal options are Aviator Yar (from 2016) and Musketeer La Forge (2017) if you want to avoid the stat total dregs like Beowulf Kim. Beyond that, he chips in a sturdy ENG base which is noticeably stronger than still-great variant La Borg. His other attribute of note is a good-not-great ship ability which grants you a chunk of crit bonus at four seconds. In the race to shorten the Skirmish grind and avoid all manner of arena hazards, it's a valid option to wield.

A note about Geordi's event history; it's weird. After four consecutive Expeditions to kick off his Timelines career, there was a question about how his future would look with that event type out of the picture. He's responded with back-to-back Skirmishes - not ideal if you're looking to gain value from your crew's bases on the weekend. With a handful of non-eventable traits beside, you'll be counting on his great daily work to mask a weekend question mark.
