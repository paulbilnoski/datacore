You've been missing something from your roster for a long time and you may not have even noticed - ENG/SEC voyagers. Outside of pack-only, out of portal Irina, the top of the voyage landscape is practically a wasteland for that skill combo. Many of us have clung tightly to our stalwart Aviator Yars (from 2016) and Musketeer La Forges (2017) for fear of having to resort to ENG/SEC crew with revolting stat totals like Beowulf Kim. Conditioned eases that burden a bit and chips in a great ENG base which is noticeably stronger than still-great variant La Borg. His other attribute of note is a good-not-great ship ability which grants you a chunk of crit bonus at four seconds. In the race to shorten the Skirmish grind and avoid all manner of arena hazards, it's a valid option to wield.

A note about Geordi's event history; it's weird. After four consecutive Expeditions to kick off his Timelines career, there was a question about how his future would look with that event type out of the picture. He's responded with back-to-back Skirmishes - not ideal if you're looking to gain value from your crew's bases on the weekend. With a handful of non-eventable traits beside, you'll be counting on his great daily work to mask a weekend question mark.
