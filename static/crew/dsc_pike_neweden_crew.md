[_Locked, cocked, and loaded_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AanN12X3PNQ&t=106) since the Big Book was a twinkle in my eye, we can finally proclaim; [_Headin' out to Eden, Yeah Brother!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDX_Qy1yKZk) This Pike hits the triumvirate of base, voyage, and event power while graciously sporting a splash of SCI to avoid the dreaded redundant skill set of redundancy. If you're after a crew comp, look no further than the recent campaign offering Professor Sato. They share a skill order so Pike is a voyage upgrade in almost every category while also septupling her event count at the cost of owning a merely mortal DIP base. If you're a free to play(er) who's hurting for big DIP due to a lack of strong mega DIP crew, Pike is someone to grab a copy of and even star up, especially if the Discovery megas keep rolling.
