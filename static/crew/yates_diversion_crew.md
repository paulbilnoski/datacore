Another day, another DIP crew you don't need. Ms. Yates makes DIP primary #6 and CMD/DIP/SEC crew #6 released over the last month. It's no longer stunning to see 1200+ bases, especially for the diplomacy skill. A day late and a dollar short for events (pilot) too, Yates' best chance for future weekend impact would seem to be wielding a top five DIP base for a theoretical costumed mega. In addition to a cookie cutter skill set and few useful traits, she lacks any pop or notable attributes, save for a chunk of shipboard crit which is usable, but replaceable. If you're okay with "stats good enough for daily use" crew, chase the ones with interesting skill sets and save your CMD/DIP/SEC hunting for the truly special cards.
