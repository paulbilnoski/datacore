He no longer owns a sterling #1 gauntlet pair, but thanks to his availability as a mega event crew, the Walls of Surak (my band's name) still echo in the gauntlet. Besides being unavoidable there, his base SCI is quite sturdy, even if his event chances are few and far between. On voyages he's a workhorse and although there's a curiously high number of SCI/DIP crew near the top, Surak is good enough to always be a superior option. One of the best daily use crew in the game and excellent right from star one.
