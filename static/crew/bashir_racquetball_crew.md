I vastly underestimated this card when I first got it often throwing it into the airlock whilst giving myself credit for collecting so many MED crew already. However although his MED/SCI stats might not be best, combined he has some great voyaging stats. His strong proficiency bonus too means he has the #2 MED score which combined with his other stats will give him use in the Gauntlet. In a bizarre move too he is somehow considered for the Sunday cadets! That and two additional collection bonuses means he is a must have crew for newer players. Be warned however, he is notoriously difficult to level up requiring lots of Ancient Films, Medical Experiments and Science Experiments which are mostly faction items.
