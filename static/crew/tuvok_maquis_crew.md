Janeway's right hand man has been equally reliable to players for years. He's slipping down the stat ranks through no fault of his own, but despite a never-ending crop of better statistical looking cards, Tuvok holds his own with a strong voyage skill set and regular events. He may not be a superstar, but you won't go too long without calling his number.
