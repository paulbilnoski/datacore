Nearly indistinguishable from Changeling Founder, and thus ranked alongside her. If you covered up the name plates, it would hard to tell the difference. Even in the arena, she's similarly useable as a quick defensive option. If you've heard good things about her anywhere but the gauntlet before, it's only because she was performing with a star advantage over other crew thanks to her Mega event.

With the Krayton generating buzz for its ability to burst damage at four seconds and new hard-hitting RP Commandant popping up, you might need faster than ever evasion crew for the Admiral division. The premier options are Laborer Spock, Minuet, and The Clown with Admiral Janeway, Judge Q, Romulan Picard, and Formal Dress Wes close behind. Other four second names include Ambassador Soval, Vedek Bareil Antos, Lore, Scientist Degra, RAF Julian Bashir, Interfaced Barclay, Nyota Uhura, Prospero Data, Defensive Phlox, Katra McCoy, Kai Opaka, Wedding Dress T'Pol, The Prophet, The Keeper (Crit bonus), White Rabbit, Yelgrun, Armed Philippa Georgiou, Captain Q, Commander Barclay, Captain Beverly Picard, and Alan-A-Dale.
