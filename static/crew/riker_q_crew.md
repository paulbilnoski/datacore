The William Riker legacy. Is it that he relinquished the incredible power of the Q for the sake of his friends? Is it the way he swings his legs over the backs of chairs and women? No, its this big, fat DIP base! By now you don't need to be told that the skill set is redundant and he offers squat in several areas such as collections and gauntlet where his proficiency total is behind over a hundred uncommon and rare crew. But we're in the middle of Rikermania with this particular variant snagging his _eleventh_ event bonus over the last year (thank you, megas). You can feel the heat coming off Victorian Pulaski's cheeks from here as RiQer lines up even more of his traits for future event work.
