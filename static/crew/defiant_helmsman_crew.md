Like our good buddy [_Vargas_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEaNKfrYUd0), 6-pack [_Wyatt_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEm-6lYMgCI) checks all the wrong boxes for crew. Not main cast, poor traits, two skills... His notable avenue for value, arena instant damage, has become little more than an [_eyebrow raiser_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNjJM2NKv1M&t=22) as ~~Vargas~~ Wyatt joins [_over a dozen other crew_](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vSZLIMkP_UnS9r3Yo3oweJNss2j9pSkUJ7tGZ-3Lpe0/edit#gid=1771252082) who fill the same role at eight seconds or better; many without Wyatt's trigger restriction. This card is definitely [_punching above his weight class_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpmLSGixYwM) with a hefty command base and if you can [_slingshot yourself back_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65nSJrF-zgw) to 2018's Pilot mega to plug him into a shuttle for a few days, by all means. Otherwise, leave this one to the collectors and head to the forums to complain about the degradation of the prestige of legendary crew.
