Once in a while DB will drop a crewmember for new players that knocks everyone else out of relevance. A new member of Riker's Angels has appeared who not only works each and every weekday but hits two extra collections. Her max ENG stat is the highest for a 2* (even beating some 3* stats) so you are likely to keep her around for a while. Shield repair on a ship ability is always nice and she has a ton of traits likely to hit a fair amount of mission nodes. Shame her card art doesn't relay her usefulness.
