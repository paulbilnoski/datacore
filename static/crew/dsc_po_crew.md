Eenie, queenie, miney...ah forget it. [_ENG is the new DIP_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=INFbPkXIO0M), it seems, with the Queen making top ten ENG crew number ten over the last five months. In other words, if you've got a fiver, DB has an "authentic" Rolex for you. Her event count reads like a Kirk or Jadzia, but might be a house of cards with Discovery as her primary weekend consideration and seemingly few eventable traits (CF). Naturally her ENG would rank highly among all of them, but depending solely on traits for event bonuses is [_playing a risky game._](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIU3HrCCT2k) Somewhat more encouraging is her voyage ability, which may feel a bit better than what's on the label. She's one of just three ENG/DIP voyagers ranked between 20th and 160th, the only crew with her particular skill order, and her voyage ENG is a robust [_number two_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB8-LXFaed4), even if, as previously noted, ENG is in the midst of a big time facelift. 

Po checks the requisite boxes for new crew - top ten base, voyage rank 20-40 - and even contributes double collections, so if you loved her role as Tilly's eccentric bud and super genius, you're okay to foray into the weekday 6-pack to snag her. Just beware that six months from now she could end up as double mega event powerhouse, pedestrian voyager #65, or anywhere in between.

[_I did it!_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIQJpWYywZU)  I got through this without a Teletubbies reference.
