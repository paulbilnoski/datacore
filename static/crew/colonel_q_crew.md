It takes a certain level of suck to make you want to avoid pulling event packs just in case you get the 5*, but the [_Qolonel manages it_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8_7Orhey-g). Maybe a year ago, he wouldn't have been putrid, but that was before the Prisoner/Interrogator mega spunked his event chances away. Even in this era of unexpected relevance through traits, the Qolonel is a zero, his biggest win being +10 Accuracy at 3 seconds in the Arena, but let's be honest, there's nothing here that Ardra can't do backwards with high heels on. In short: [_no_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yfr_Zj1iU4).
