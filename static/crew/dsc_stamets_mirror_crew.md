Just like his brother Navigator Stamets, Mirror debuted with a #1 Discovery base (now #3) and above average voyage numbers. The time since has not been kind to him, however. 2019 has been the year of the rare skill set, which includes ENG/MED, and a couple better Discovery SCI options (and SCI in general) were added. The skill set and multi-week splash potential are still attributes you want to acquire for your roster, but aren't as rare as they once were. Think of him as da Vinci junior with a less daily maneuverability, but explosive event potential.
