One of the more mediocre Disco crew unless you have a particularly fledgling roster, Airiam does at least contribute +1 Engineered and a snappy 4 second Attack boost, as well as the relatively uncommon SCI/CMD stack. This bionic bod will do just fine on voyages and the occasional event, but you're very unlikely to unfreeze her once she's discovered your vault.
