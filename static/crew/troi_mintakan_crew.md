Ever wonder what she's carrying in her basket?. The answer is all her freaking traits. Thirteen (!!!) to help trigger voyage and event bonuses when you least expect them. She's well into double-digit events and sports the #2 DIP base to go with it. Her voyage DIP is nearly 100 points better than the next 3-skiller and because of how voyage totals tend to curve at the top and bottom, her top 5 overall voyage total is almost 100 points better than #20.
