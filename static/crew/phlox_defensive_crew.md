He's an absolute unit. In awe of the proficiency of this lad. Like most gauntleteers, don't let the above ranks trouble you - He's also one of the top voyage MED numbers with the biggest MED proficiency of anyone in the game. The chink in his dice rolling armor is a minimum proficiency lower than some common super rares like Mirror Phlox and Nurse Garland. You'll be tilted more than once by low rolls that cost you a matchup you're "supposed to win". But considering the dearth of MED crew as the least represented skill in the game and his handy skill set shared by only Merry Men Crusher at the legendary level, his reputation is well earned as a gauntlet and voyage force.
