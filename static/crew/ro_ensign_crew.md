Ro is a bit of an odd one. Her CMD stat starts with a high base but she is easily outperformed by other crew members by having a poorer proficiency. She can however work in all the cadet missions, has a hefty +4 attack score for ship battles and is one of the easiest crewmembers to equip. Worth keeping around as backup for Sito on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
