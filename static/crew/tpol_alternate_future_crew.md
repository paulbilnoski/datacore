Despite relatively few traits, AF T'Pol has climbed to double digit events and owns the #1 CMD base for both her variants and the Vulcanians. In addition, she's on the short list of the best CMD/SCI voyagers. Although her only other fringe offering is a middling gauntlet pair, AF T'Pol has a good enough blend of power and usefulness to be a regular fixture on any roster.
