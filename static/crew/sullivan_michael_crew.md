[_His fingernails seem a bit ragged for a Bartender_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUZaGjfVLCM&t=5)...and his MED a bit high. But his only chances to use it in the future would seem to be Hologram events and/or a Romantic mega - the latter of which has a pool of crew which may have ballooned too big to be of any use. Be a lad and give him fair haven in your cryostasis vault.
