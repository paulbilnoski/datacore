Finally, in 2019, MED crew are beginning to take their place among other skills in terms of power and availability, to the detriment of this Bashir variant. Like rings on a tree, he marks the 2018 era of power creep; he's hundreds of points better on voyages than older MED options, but hundreds below new ones. Similarly for base, he's no longer the low water mark for event competition thanks to recent mega Qod who he sits 100 points behind, along with a few other names. Whether this relative MED explosion will sustain has yet to be seen, but BR Bashir has drifted out of the powerful set and landed in the 'merely' good group.
