Dolim's value used to be lost in [_the pit of despair_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z05StkAKKF0), but he's since picked up a vanity collection and a mega's worth of events. There's some wiggle room on future weekend bonuses from traits, but that's mostly theoretical value at this point. His daily power is abysmal and none of the dabo-able ships have the position ability required to activate his arena damage.
