Somewhere there's [_a horn section blasting a jazzy reprise of Trek music_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-QBe9pPdkM). DS9 is old enough now that we can look back at this heap of campy schmaltz with fondness ... The skill set won't look great on the behold screen, but Sisko is one of the very best crew who wears it. The top SEC base with regular event work would be good enough for most cards, but he throws in hefty voyage power to go with it. The shuttle advantage he provides may not be as big as it would if he weren't a previous campaign crew, but as SEC has more Faction event seats than any other skill, you'll have no trouble plugging him in there, almost without exception. Trepidation about Roller's common skill set is understandable, but he's a legitimate citation target as one of the more powerful crew in the game.
