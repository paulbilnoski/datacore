Somewhere there's [_a horn section blasting a jazzy reprise of Trek music_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-QBe9pPdkM). DS9 is old enough now that we can look back at this heap of campy schmaltz with fondness ... After several other skills had received significant jumps in base power, I had been crying caution when former SEC leader Falcon's name came up. A changing of the guard _did_ happen (what a prophet!), but in the gentlest way possible.

Falcon 2.0 owns the big bazooka now with refreshed voyage power and consistent event work thus far. Unlike a strong non-event base, there are very few reasons for me to knock Roller's High SEC. He has the requisite bonus count to provide monster weekends and will pick up non-bonus work the rest of the time thanks to SEC being the single most common shuttle seat in events. Trepidation about Roller's common skill set is understandable, but he's a legitimate citation target as one of the more powerful crew in the game.
