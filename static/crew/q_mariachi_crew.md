If you have Mariachi at some middling star level from the free mailed copy and/or his event then he's fine to take a star on, but starting from scratch for a cookie cutter crew who doesn't warm up before 4/5 is a losing proposition. His bi-yearly event features will serve to occasionally remind you of why he's hogging a crew slot, but don't figure to get daily use out of him.
