2018 was a bad year for Curzon's host. Professor Sato took a dump on the DIP ranks below her and more recently an Archer variant displaced Odo from the #2 base spot as well. Events and bases as a whole lost a bit of lustre with the introduction of a new ranked reward system where high event count crew no longer win you more of the same, but rather a lottery draw of next week's random legendary. There's also his redundant skill set and zeroes for the gauntlet, arena, and collections to consider.

But the key to his respectable rating here and in the opinion of many players isn't found on most spreadsheets or wiki pages; he counts as bonus for Dax events as well (click the link in his name for more info). He's still rock solid for events as an obviously variant(s)-best DIP and a shuttle all star.
