Crusher? I hardly know her! Think Cornwell-lite when it comes to Mirror Bev. Her MED base isn't quite variant-best (Merry Men Crusher), but her DIP is. While her voyage total is sinking about as fast as a North Star passenger liner, a MED primary skill set means she'll feel it markedly less, even with a number of new, superior MED crew joining the fray, and she may well be worth taking in a Behold on that basis alone. The Crushers' weakness has historically been event count, but this Bev is aided by the mirror trait and is, in fact, the #1 Mirror MED base.
