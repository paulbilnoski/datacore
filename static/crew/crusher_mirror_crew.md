Crusher? I hardly know her! Think Cornwell-lite when it comes to Mirror Bev. Her MED base isn't quite variant-best (Merry Men Crusher), but her DIP is. And a sub-100 voyage total is far better in the context of how many old and weak MED crew there are. The Crushers' weakness has historically been event count, but this Bev is aided by the mirror trait and is, in fact, the #1 Mirror MED base.
