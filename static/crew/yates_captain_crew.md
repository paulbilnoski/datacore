Another CMD/SEC/DIP combination crew, yawn. Kasidy here isn't even among the best of them with the #12 CMD base for 3* crews. She has a couple of useful traits and her Arena ability isn't to be sniffed at. But with Dax, Janeway and Lursa beating here in command stats for Saturday cadets and contributing towards a collection bonus don't feel bad if you have to show Kasidy to the bad side of an airlock.
