You may have seen "weak Surak clone" thrown around before and it's regrettably true. She's buried behind a couple different walls for her two ranked gauntlet pairs and her voyage numbers leave a lot to be desired. While more useful for new players, she'll find herself edged out on established rosters. But where she comes into relevance is events. Two megas, a handful of trait events, and a half dozen T'Pol events (two features) for which she has two variant-best bases all constitute a considerable amount of work. She's no powerhouse, but her name will pop up more often than you expect on the weekend.
