#1 3* SCI boy wonder here destroys most SCI stats in rare leagues. Even his ENG score is very respectable which makes him one of the few two skilled crewmembers to be useful on a voyage. He is just one collection and ship skill away from being top tier however but that does not belittle his usefulness. DB confirming that Ensigns in this game are somehow far superior than most of the Captains.
