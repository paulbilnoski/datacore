A different flavour of Archer from a different time. A time of daring, a time of reaching beyond the limits. An Archer that will fly right into the Danger Zone. Which is my way of saying that this Archer is a little different, sporting a unique, and rather hefty, top 10 SCI base, and the overall best ENG of any of the Archers, including the 5* variants. +1 Inspiring is always nice to snag for cards that otherwise might be lacking in long term benefits.

Archer's events have been picking up as of late, but he still has some catching up to do - and his skillset, while not exactly rare anymore, is still handy to have in abundance if you want your voyages to go further, faster, more. A lack of Gauntlet play or particularly eventable traits, and a pretty poor ship ability, hold him back from being truly great, but especially on younger rosters, he's going to serve you extremely well. Even more seasoned crew quarters can find a place for him on voyages or daily shuttles.
