I'm conflicted on Hockey Kim. On one side he's a perfectly viable Voyager with an average spread of abilities. His #7 ENG base is fairly respectable and the proficiencies keep him in the upper echelon of engineers. However there are a few other ENG crews that can do the same job and more. Hockey Harry here can't work weekends but if you are struggling for ENG crew he's a viable option.
