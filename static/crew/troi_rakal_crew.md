Well-rounded crew. A murderer's row of faction items are required to equip her, but she pays off the investment more often than not. Far more useful on voyages than her total indicates - she covers two underrepresented skill sets; MED/CMD and MED/SEC. Troi + Romulan events, but with bases topping out at 525, you may stop unfreezing her at some point. Monstrous passive arena EV with solid 300% instant damage means you probably already see her there fairly often.
