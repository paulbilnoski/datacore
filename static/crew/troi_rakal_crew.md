A well-rounded crew, but deficient numbers in every phase of daily play. Far more useful on voyages than her total indicates - she covers two underrepresented skill sets; MED/CMD and MED/SEC, but ends up still being replaceable, even by 1/5s. Troi + Romulan events, but with bases topping out at 525, you may stop unfreezing her at some point. Monstrous passive arena EV with solid 300% instant damage means you probably already see her there fairly often. A murderer's row of faction items is required to equip her, but she pays off the investment more often than not.
