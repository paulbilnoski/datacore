The only Odo with SCI, Pabst leverages above average base and voyage numbers to appear a little more useful than he is. An Accuracy boosting ship ability on an 8 second fuse is about all there is to otherwise recommend a determinedly milquetoast card. Overall, he'll serve you well. [_Just don't expect him to be there for your child_](https://youtu.be/puaD_5H0xsU?t=129).
