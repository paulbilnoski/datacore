The only Odo with SCI, Pabst leverages a top 50 voyage total and a handsome CMD base to appear a little more useful than he is. An Accuracy boosting ship ability on an 8 second fuse is about all there is to otherwise recommend a determinedly milquetoast card. Overall, he'll serve you well. Just don't expect him to be there for your child.
