Several newer ENG/CMD super rares may have bumped this Geordi from usefulness there, but a good base + event pairing and a stat-boosting collection make him handy to have, even in cryo. A solid all-'rounder, and the only 4* Age of Sail crew - useful if a vanity collection ever decides to materialise on your transporter pad.
