Though SEC/SCI is well known as a useful skill set, he lacks the voyage power to make an impact beyond the early game. Thankfully, his hefty event count (including three features) and Vulcan collection make him an occasional contributor on even established rosters. A slow-activating instant damage with good passive crit may make an appearance in skirmishes or for young rosters. A fairly easy build by Spock standards, but make sure to ad-warp some cadet missions to meet his 40 2* IDIC requirement.
