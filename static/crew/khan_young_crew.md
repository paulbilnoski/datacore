[_Young Khan, get outta my mind_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJFVPxBpezk) and take that song with you. [_Dreamy mid-century Montalban_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8q7Z_cJGdnI) is a hell of a vintage and you'll certainly want to scoop up this version for his event potential and collection spot. An event count which is modest at a glance is overripe with trait mega possibilities and should have him making the thaw list several times with two usable-when-bonus bases.
