His numbers don't jump off the page and aren't even average in many cases, but with Sarek, Vulcan, and Disco bonuses supplementing his base and a little SEC/SCI voyage action, Suus Mahna gets his number called more often than you might realize. As long the Disco mega bubble exists, so will his value. His other great utility is a T'kuvma-esque arena offering where his eerily similar passive stats meet an even greater 400% instant damage. You're missing out on a juicy +Attack stat, but considering his utility elsewhere, he can certainly find ways to perform on your roster.
