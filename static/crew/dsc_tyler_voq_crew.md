Tyler is an event primary, event secondary crew. There are no other interesting corners of this card to delve into and despite passable voyage numbers, his skill set is likely to sink that total in "real feel" situations. Nevertheless, his event potential earns this card consideration. Double 1k bases in combination with Disco, Klingon, and Tyler events should be enough to help you out on weekends several times per year, even if the megas stop.
