There was a time when [_the joining_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB368EgyOpI) of Dax and Mirror events would have made us weak in the knees, but time has not been kind to Ezri's bases. Even now, in the midst of what is likely her last chance for a multi-week impact in the Scoundrel mega, her upper limit is probably requisition shuttle for many rosters.
