Christmas in July? It sure seems so as Quinn, the rare reward for a mission in Episode 10, is a base and voyage powerhouse. His event eligibility is yet to be determined (he lacks the Q invisi-trait that John de Lancie's variants have), but with daily use numbers like Quinn boasts, he might not need them. The #2 CMD/DIP/SEC voyage score and a top three base will garner him about as much work as he can handle on any roster. There are downsides aplenty (skill set, no events, DIP primary, no gauntlet/arena work) and his ranking here will drop faster than some crew, but he's also a statistical force who beams himself and an ad-warped copy onto your ship for free.
