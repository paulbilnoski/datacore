Christmas in July? It sure seems so as Quinn, the rare reward for a mission in Episode 10, is a base and voyage powerhouse. His event future isn't all that promising, his best bet being a fringe Explorer mega, but with daily use numbers like Quinn boasts, he might not need them. The #2 CMD/DIP/SEC voyage score and a top three base will garner him about as much work as he can handle on any roster. There are downsides aplenty (skill set, no events, DIP primary, no gauntlet/arena work) and his ranking here will drop faster than some crew, but he's also a statistical force [_who beams himself_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vx3mUoQDyrU) and an ad-warped copy onto your ship for free.
