Irina's ([_no, not that one_](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Irina_Galliulin)) numbers are still impressive, even as she enters the portal, but when that first layer is peeled back, she ends up a shade off elite. The Pilot mega has passed, leaving in its wake few event chances for her. Time has worked its magic on a formerly great ENG base and because of a trio of ENG megas and limited Faction seating opportunities, she may be limited to daily shuttles or the occasional requisition. Where she's undeniable is on voyages. Irina is among the top voyage ENG and the best option for ENG/SEC runs despite a slew of 2019 additions. Whenever a crew is _the best_ at something rather than just great, their contributions to your roster are going to be safe for a while, even in the face of power creep.

Her other components are somewhat lacklustre; bland in the arena and medium strength proficiency rolls come together for a #3 gauntlet pair which, if it's that important to you, super rare  [_Grand Proxy Neelix_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XK-sMYaV0A&t=79)  is there for. The wrench in this crew eval is her spot in Jury Rigger. It still requires a few legendary crew to complete and many are flat out bad. If Irina is one of the options you have available to help finish it, you won't regret what she offers once the collection smoke clears.
