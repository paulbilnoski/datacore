Irina's numbers are no doubt great, but when that first layer is peeled back, she ends up a shade off elite. The Pilot mega has passed, leaving in its wake few chances at events for Irina. A formerly strong ENG base is one of the less impressive ones because of that fact, because of "recent" ENG megas, and because it's far behind CMD/DIP/SEC for Faction seating opportunities. She'll excel for daily shuttles, but is unlikely to blow you away the rest of the time. Where she's undeniable is on voyages. Irina is the #2 voyage ENG and best option for ENG/SEC runs despite a slew of recent additions. Whenever a crew is the best at something rather than just great, their contributions to your roster are going to be safe for a while, even in the face of power creep.

Her other components are somewhat lacklustre; bland in the arena and medium strength proficiency rolls come together for a #3 gauntlet pair which, if it's that important to you, super rare Grand Proxy Neelix is there for. The wrench in this crew eval is her spot in Jury Rigger. It still requires a few legendary crew to complete and many are flat out bad. If Irina is one of the options you have available to help finish it, you won't regret what she offers once the collection smoke clears.
