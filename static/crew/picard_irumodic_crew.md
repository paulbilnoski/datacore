What's that old codger got in his hand? Not a bottle of corner shop piss, that's for certain. The #7 overall voyage total, +1 Veteran, the illusive Gardener trait (surely due a mega), and, until Mambo Picard is fused to 4/5, the best option for Picard SCI - which makes this pack only offering rather better than you might initially think.
