What's that old codger got in his hand? [_Not a bottle of corner shop piss_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RedqjMy62HQ), that's for certain. Great voyage power, +1 Veteran, the illusive Gardener trait (surely due a mega), and, until Mambo Picard is fused to 4/5, the best option for Picard SCI - which makes this pack only offering rather better than you might initially think.
