This woman will literally wade through the blood of her digital enemies. The highest 2* SEC base in the game and a fairly respectable DIP score. Her SEC use will dominate the early game and make two days worth of cadet challenges quite meaningless. She will only drop out of use once you have a few 3* crewmembers levelled up.
