A very average performing Diplomat in terms of pure stats. She sits in the middle of the 3* DIP crew with not much to add via proficiency. Her use comes primarily to unlock a node on the cadet missions and to score in two additional collections. Cretak can participate in both weekend missions which is a bonus but after that consider getting her immortalised to make way for better DIP crew.
