Discovery season two did indeed herald the arrival of Nu-Pike, but that doesn't make Hunter's Pike much more useful. This variant won't trigger for a Disco mega and if future Pike events take place during one, there's a handful of better Disco CMD options available. His usage/power is too poor otherwise except in the arena. A combination of +10 attack and fast activation is not particularly common and would be fine for ship battles if the cost to FF wasn't so high. Even if Anson mounts a Pike comeback, you'll be underwhelmed by this version.
