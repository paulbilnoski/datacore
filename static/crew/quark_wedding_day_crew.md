They say that a rose smells as sweet by any other name. Well, this particular rose stinks, even with his new moniker. A nearly carbon copy of Klingon Quark, Wedding Day Quark hails from a fun episode, but brings none of that joy with him. With marginally better bases than his doppelganger, and roughly the same event eligibility, he might be worth unfreezing a few times a year, but otherwise, keep him out of the way for +1 Ferengi.
