A nice change of pace from all the ENG primary [_Datas_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1tHYx_sr6o) and sits smack dab in the middle of his variants' voyage totals. We'd like to see better voyage numbers from a more recent card, but there's no denying Data's rock solid event history which gives AoS plenty of chances to leverage a variant-best CMD. A chunk of arena damage always catches the eye, but an unfortunate combination of trigger and poor passive stats brings him in a hair behind more available options like Covert Leland or Survivalist Kirk.
