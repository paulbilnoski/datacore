A good daily use crew with viable voyage power, tertiary ENG to keep him competitive, and an 800+ base SEC. Though his event chances are limited, I'm still turning purple from holding my breath waiting for a main series Captain to garner more respect in the future. At least he has the good fortune to carry a few eventable traits for down the line.
