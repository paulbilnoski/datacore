Often imitated, rarely duplicated - the originator of the coveted ENG/SCI/MED skill set has attracted a half dozen followers to its ranks, but the skill set remains undeniably valuable. His daily use value is off the charts; he's irreplaceable for a few different voyage combos and has two shuttle-worthy bases. Once in a while you'll see him stroll through the gauntlet saloon doors when his #2 ranked pair and 65% crit trait set align. And when you immortalize him (and you will immortalize him), he hits on two stat-boosting collections. Spotty-at-best event and gauntlet work are unable to prop up slowly drooping stat ranks, but a rare skill combo and stats that still demand daily work ensure that his slide will be a graceful one.
