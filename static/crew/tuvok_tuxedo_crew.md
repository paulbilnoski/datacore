Curiously "low" voyage numbers for a crew so recent; in fact lower than every event crew in the three months prior. Debuting with a middling number there and a Diplomacy primary doesn't bode well for his efficacy in the future. Working in his favor is a chunk of SEC/SCI that most Tuvok variants supply, but what he provides on voyages would seem to be the side dish to his bases. 

Tuvok's event chances have never been prodigious, but in combination with the Vulcan trait have actually grown each of the last three years and he's now claimed a featured event in four consecutive years. His #2 Vulcan DIP slots in behind only The Prophet and is enough to grant him weekend work while a 1k SECondary will lend some Faction flexibility as well. He's not special, or even great, but he's a fine event puzzle piece who will perform similarly to former "strong" voyagers.
