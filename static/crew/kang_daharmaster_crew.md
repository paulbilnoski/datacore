Double 1k bases and double collections are generally attributes to target, but Kang is more of an empty calories crew. He's a trait-relevance-only shuttler who's already had Klingon tapped for their mega and his proficiencies are too poor to benefit from the exclusive Dahar Master gauntlet trait set. He'll perform above average when his number is called, but that happens far too infrequently to merit taking him over most other behold choices.
