Average CMD/DIP/SEC voyagers grow on trees and there's not much gauntlet value here either. The two points of interest are an instant activation arena EV ([_with some ugly numbers, but it's still an option_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khzHOUcLpiE)) and more importantly; event work. Sarek, Mirror, Vulcan, and Disco events all trigger bonuses for Prophet to make him (one of) the first crew to 30 bonuses and in combination with a strong, common-for-shuttles DIP, The Prophet is a name you'll end up utilizing more often than you might think.

Owning the #1 Sarek/Mirror/Vulcan DIP all in one package is quite valuable and even though it ranks a bit lower among Disco crew, they've been collecting events at an incredible clip and we welcome trait bonuses wherever we can get them. He may get lost in the voyage and gauntlet wash, but shuttle-quality DIP and loads of chances for weekend work is valuable enough to make Prophet worth acquiring as a stash crew.
