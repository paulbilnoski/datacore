Much like his dreamboat on-screen character, The Outrageous Okona gives us just what we want. Okona uses his proficiencies, including the #1 DIP/ENG gauntlet pair, to deliver sturdy voyage numbers; third highest for his skill set. His voyage usability makes him one of the preferred options to immortalize en route to finishing the Jury Rigger collection which still requires a few legendary crew to complete. He may not be an event all-star, but as the Q/Scoundrel mega demonstrated, you can never count out the more obscure traits from coming in during a clinch.
