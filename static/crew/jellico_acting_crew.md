Sporting stats that would have made him merely okay crew this time last year, Jellico is a classic example of all base, no trousers. Let's run it down, shall we? A duo of events, unlikely to be duplicated, originating from his Acting Captaincy, and almost completely uneventable traits. A voyage score surrounded by superior bases and bridge crew with quintuple the event count, coupled with a real stinker of a skill set. The only things that are even remotely attractive are a top 10 base, a collection that doesn't require a single 5*, and a measly 300% instant damage ability. On a 12 second timer. With a Position trigger. [_Localised entirely within your space kitchen_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4lnZr022M8).

Can I see it working out?  [_No_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM-e46xdcUo).

In his episode, Jellico told others to get it done, and regardless of your feelings about him, they got it done. But if you're looking for a card to get it done, this ain't it, chief.
