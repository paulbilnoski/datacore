David Duchovny has the good fortune of collecting the Mirror trait (and associated traits) to boost his event count up into double-digits. With only the out-of-portal Mirror Sulu ahead of him for Mirror SEC, he might need to get lucky with traits as Reed events are stuck in the mud leaving two variant-best bases rotting away. 375% arena damage is a big torpedo, but getting to 12 seconds alive is increasingly difficult these days. Still a valuable Skirmish piece until you're able to acquire faster options. He is, like many others, a bit player waiting on events and not quite able to contribute otherwise on some rosters.
