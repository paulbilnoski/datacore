How much do you like running Ferengi faction missions? Not at all, well tough luck. This latinum loving lobe lad is going to be lingering around your crew slots for a while unless you pony up the merits or replicator rations for faction items. His stats are fairly average and might get some use on Saturday's missions if you don't already have someone better. His main attractive features are the dual Ferengi and Diplomat collection bonuses and he might get some use whilst Voyaging but that's about it.
