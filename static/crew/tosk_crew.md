His ENG base is among the least common shuttle skills and there are already three mega crew with better base ENG to fill those non-bonus faction seats. A zero for voyages/gauntlet and his arena EV activates after almost all instant damage crew have blown you to bits. His number was called for a recent mega event and may pop in a weekend or two down the line, but chasing obscure and volatile work should really only be an option if your other behold choices are equally useless or bland.
