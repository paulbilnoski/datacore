Second best 1* MED score, #18 overall, two additional collections (Physician and Engineered) and a very good early game ship ability make this one of the better cards to keep. The cyberneticist trait will be useful early on and once you get the point of freezing crew he can start three collections off quite nicely. His main let down is a pointless command statistic which can be easily ignored.
