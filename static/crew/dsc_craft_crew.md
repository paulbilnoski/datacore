New crew usually bring a little bit of excitement as to what their stats can bring to new players sadly our Craft here is aptly stranded among the average cards. His SEC base will bring a bit of power to shuttles if you are missing some of the bigger players but his real let down is a disappointing Voyage total. Alongside being yet another SEC/CMD crew to grace the roster one will find his uses limited once the bigger rarity cards start dropping. Consider The Viceroy or Boxer Chakotay for stronger alternatives.
