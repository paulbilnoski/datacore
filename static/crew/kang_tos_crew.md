Another common pairing...oh wait, yes but this is a good one! A very strong voyager with a heap of useful traits and a good ship skills ideal for Arena. His individual stats might not be amazing but combined they might just help you hit a four hour voyage. Take this guy over any of the other Rare Klingons.
