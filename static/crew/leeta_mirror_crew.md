Your garden variety filler card with a dash of power creep, though she offers more than meets the eye. A hefty chunk of crit rating at four seconds with better than average passive stats for the arena is probably her most useful daily attribute. Top 1/3rd voyage numbers are good enough to crack into many players' rotation, even in the common skill set. But if you need an excuse to take the high heeled heel, bank on her modest number of traits which should continue to produce weekend bonuses. Not bad for Chase Masterson's easiest paycheck.
