Your garden variety filler card with a dash of power creep, though she offers more than meets the eye. A hefty chunk of crit rating at four seconds with better than average passive stats for the arena is probably her most useful attribute. The mirror tag will pull her out of cryo from time to time, but it's nice to have a couple extra traits (Bajoran, Romantic) that have a real chance to grant an event bonus down the line. Top 1/3rd voyage numbers are good enough to crack into many players' rotation, even in the common skill set. Not bad for Chase Masterson's easiest paycheck.
