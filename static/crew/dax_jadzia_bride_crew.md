It's not often I go out of my way to compliment a Dax, but Bride is more useful than her numbers look. She's already picked up two megas to go with Dax's hefty event count which trumps base ranks when she's getting so much use out of them. Her proficiencies result in only a single ranked gauntlet pair, but with so many traits, she performs like Guinan-lite as a DIP primary. DIP/SCI isn't hurting for voyage options, but the vast majority of crew rated better are total event non-starters; something worth considering if you prefer crew who can do it all. If you're only after big base or voyage numbers that's understandable, but Bride's versatility warrants consideration, even if she doesn't offer anything elite day to day.
