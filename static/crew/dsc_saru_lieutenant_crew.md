It's a close call between the top 2* SCI crew but Saru is a worthy contender in that category. He's a solid choice to run SCI missions and his ship ability is solid for first time arena use. Being an Alien and having a fearless SCI base gets him a good amount of use in the majority of cadet missions. A healthy secondary command score will get him on your voyages but sadly, no additional collection bonuses.
