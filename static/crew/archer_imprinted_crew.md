The year of the ENG/MED/SCI crew keeps on rolling, and for the first-ever MED primary with the coveted trifecta, DB gives us the legendary doctor...Archer? Mother Hen Jonathan is bugging out in a big way, but he winds up being much more White Rabbit than Leonardo Da Vinci in overall impact. Exclusive stats like his have value, and he's guaranteed seats on voyages, but no matter the skill set, you never want to see a crew with a voyage total worse than luminaries like Judge Q and Revolutionary Damar. The outlook is even worse on the weekends, as only one of Archer's three events has been Faction, and even it was a hybrid. If the stars align and Archer's number is finally called for a Faction event, Bug Brain would bring variant-best MED and ENG to the table, but if you think that's at all likely, you're really sniffing Xindi slime.
