Base and voyage numbers are fairly usable for newer players, but he contributes nothing else. It's not hard to see another [_repeat of his event_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/The_Captain%27s_Oath_2), perhaps giving you an easy way to snag a star, but going by his traits, that's the upper limit of his chances at relevance. He's not so bad that a star advantage wouldn't give him some use on the average roster, but if you select him it's because he's [_mother fuckin' Frasier Crane_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXSjsf9SsGQ).
