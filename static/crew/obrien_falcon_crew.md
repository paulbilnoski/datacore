His character may be [_reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed1ofgp0Y9I&t=30), but Falcon is all business. His SEC base is already legendary, but he had spent so much time at the top that it's only natural for power creep to start catching up. Are we going to see a Professor Sato-like dumpstering of O'Brien in the future? The answer was kind to everyone's favourite Emilio Largo knockoff, as new #1 Sisko betters him by only a few points. With voyage numbers now way on the wrong side of 100 and only two O'Brien events over the last 18 months, his #2 base ranking is essential to his value. With any luck, his fall from grace will continue to be a gentle tumble, but for now he's got one of the biggest guns in town.
