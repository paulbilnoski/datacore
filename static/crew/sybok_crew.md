 His badass villain name isn't even the best thing about this guy. Good-to-great stats across the board including top 50 voyage numbers, an 800+ DIP base, double collections, Vulcan events, and usable arena EV as the cherry on top. His only real drawbacks are not having variant events and an expensive build consisting of the typical Vulcan faction items and nearly twenty 4* components. He may not get you to Sha-Ka-Ree, but he _will_ get you where you need to go.
