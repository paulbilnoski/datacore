Trekkies who adore good ol' Doc now have a proper vessel to channel their love into. The ignorant Kyrians unwittingly gave us a couple more event chances to play with thanks to Android and several other villainous traits. The EMA promises to make good use of them with not only a top five MED base, but a SECondary that's 622 points better than the next Doc option.

As potent as that all sounds, his voyage work is even better and may rival ENG/MED as the combo that nobody talks about. There are a grand total of four legendary voyagers with MED and SEC as their top two skills, two with MED+CMD, and EMA easily outpaces them all. He's not just the only legendary with his skill set, he's also the #1 voyage MED for 3-skill crew, the #3 MED+CMD total, and is guaranteed a seat for a long, long time until at least two handfuls of crew are added above his power level. If you were happy with Katrina Cornwell, you'll fall in love with Doctor Evil.
