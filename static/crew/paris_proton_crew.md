He's been featured event crew four times and is over double-digit events, but outside of that he offers nothing aside from an extremely torturous and expensive build. 132 0* holoprograms are needed and you'll likely be replicating multiple 5* items just to shunt him off to stasis. You'll want him eventually for events, but make sure your inventory can take the hit of his build cost before using behold capital on him.
