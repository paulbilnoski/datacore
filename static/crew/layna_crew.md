"Just a pretty face" is the phrase that comes to mind for Layna. With desolate event chances, her bases are likely to be stuck hauling the odd daily shuttle and even then, not until higher star counts given the ubiquity of DIP characters. Her shot at earning a roster spot falls mainly on her voyage contributions. The DIP/SCI pairing is not at all uncommon, but top 1/3rd raw numbers will earn her at least some play unless you've targeted the numerous similar skill sets from top 15 voyagers.
