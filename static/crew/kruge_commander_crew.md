For pure security power you can't go wrong with Kruge, so his use on a Sunday cadet mission will help knock off a few nodes or two. Once that is completed then his usefulness is limited. His ship ability requires a ship with the boarding trait and his voyaging scores are poor. Keep if you need the SEC but he will be easily replaced by some of the first SR cards you get.
