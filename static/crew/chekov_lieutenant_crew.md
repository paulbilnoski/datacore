There are many things to like about this Chekov. The way his shapely hips flow in this unappealing brown pyjama suit. His perfectly parted hair. His top ten voyage total. Hm. His #19 base SEC? I'm sorry, there's just not much to say about poor young Pavel here. He's by all means a good card, with a bit of SCI to help him stay relevant, but when the two cards beside you in voyage total have triple your event count, you do tend to get lost in the crowd without collections or a particularly noteworthy ship ability. On the plus side, 3 of Chekov's 4 events have been Faction based, so he's probably going to be worth unfreezing eventually - just not any time soon.
