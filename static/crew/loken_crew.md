A crew guaranteed to make you dig deep into Memory Alpha, and even then probably say "Oh, ok, I kinda remember," Loken's ENG/SCI/MED skill set commands attention no matter how memorable his character is. It's a great mix, of course, though ENG/SCI isn't particularly rare anymore, and the MED is token at best, leaving his overall voyage numbers squarely in good-not-great territory. The new #6 ENG base is nice too, but DB seems to be cranking out top 10 Engineers with a quickness lately, so he doesn't stand too far out from any of them. If you like using cloak ships, his 400% instant damage at 8 seconds can be handy, as is his ability to slot into harder-to-fill ship slots. Three traits is a bummer, and his event chances will depend heavily on whether he is part of the upcoming mega or not (_Narrator_: he wasn't). All things considered, he's one of the lesser ENG/MED crew, but will still be a handy card to have around.
