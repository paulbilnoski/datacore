Strong voyage numbers are most notable even if it's not the best early game skill set. His SCI base used to be a better option, but will likely struggle to find a seat with increased competition from the likes of several Discovery crew. A "use" crew if you can star him up early, but slim long term benefits since he doesn't get a cut of the Dominion event pie. A somewhat tricky [_node unlock_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Into_the_Lion%27s_Den) gives him niche early game use - just don't expect him to come out of the freezer once you've starred him up and completed his fairly expensive build.
