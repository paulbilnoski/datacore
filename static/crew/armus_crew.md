After the awesome dominance of The Caretaker, Armus seems like a step down as the rare gauntlet reward. And he is. But perhaps he's at a more suitable power level for a crew whose acquisition is a game of chance. Like other gauntlet rewards (except Locutus), he doesn't offer anything for events or on ships and shuttles. His stat-boosting collection spot is a perk and worth several times a normal collection spot due to its exclusivity, even if it's a fairly miniscule boost overall. He's fine for voyages; about average by the numbers and even though SCI/CMD isn't the black hole that it used to be, it's still more useful than many skill sets.

For anyone considering citations in a collection-chasing effort, that's rarely going to be the best use of your honor. He's not good enough outside of the gauntlet to be worth the citations and with the change to gauntlet reward exclusivity, additional copies will continue to trickle in. That all being said, he's still a fantastic option for professional coin flipping enthusiasts. His #1 SCI proficiency will pick up plenty of wins in conjunction with his penchant for collecting 65% crit and a #1 ranked pair is always valuable, even if it was (almost) recently matched.
