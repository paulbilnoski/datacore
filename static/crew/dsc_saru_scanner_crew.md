Strong SCI base paired with an event clip that has been unbelievable thus far. May find a home as a rare 2-skill voyager thanks to huge voyage SCI and #1 CMD+SCI total. Now we're on our third Disco mega, Mr. Shape of Water's value is well proven, and looks set to continue thanks to his bridge crew status.
