His time in the sun came and went during the Dominion mega (#4 Dominion CMD), but if you didn't have him, then you weren't missing much. An unimpressive base CMD and voyage score that just doesn't play with his skill set make this cookie cutter crew more of a hassle than he's really worth. Depending on your luck with Dilemmas, you may need to spend some campaign citations to unlock his best offering; a spot in the Diplomat collection.
