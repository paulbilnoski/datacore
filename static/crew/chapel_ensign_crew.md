For a medic she's got a pretty poor medicine stats, doesn't fill out the "Do No Harm" collection and a poor ship ability. Not that this counts for 1* crew but she is the worst Voyager in the game. The only reason you should immortalize her is if you have absolutely nothing left to do in the game and have a fetish for wasting chronitons.
