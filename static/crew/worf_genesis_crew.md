There's not much to unpack for Proto Worf. He's just what he looks like; an event crew worth a spot in your tool belt. The best SEC and #2 CMD bases among Worfs (Worves?) as well as sharing the #2 Klingon SEC with Janeway. With traits he's well into double-digit events and is still a capable shuttle pilot, despite offering little else.
