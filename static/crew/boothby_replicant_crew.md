A little MED can go a long way. In Boothby's case, it makes him one of four crew with his skill set in the top 100 voyagers and gives him a great matchup advantage in gauntlet encounters. Arguably the most interesting part of this crew comes in the gauntlet. If you've been flying Air Surak since last year's mega and have the chance to pivot to Boothby, now might be a good time. His three ranked pairs include a #2 SCI/DIP which edges out Surak by a small margin and can easily two-for-one new gauntlet exclusive Armus - the blob who also toppled Surak from the SCI/CMD catbird seat.

In short, Boothby's skill set makes him a great choice to break up SCI-centric walls in the gauntlet and, in combination with a huge stat total, makes him one of the best voyagers in the game. There are definite holes to Boothby's game - a lack of event work and unexciting arena prospects - and relative to the strength of newer cards, his bases are merely ok. But your gauntlet five and especially voyage runs will no doubt benefit from this great daily use crew.
