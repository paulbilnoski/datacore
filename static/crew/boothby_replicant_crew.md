A little MED can go a long way. In Boothby's case, it makes him one of five crew with his skill set in the top 100 voyagers, a totally unique skill order, and gives him a great matchup advantage in gauntlet encounters. If you've missed out on the ubiquitous Surak or Locutus, Boothby is a fair re-creation. His three ranked pairs include a #2 SCI/DIP which edges out Surak by a small margin and can easily two-for-one new gauntlet exclusive Armus - the blob who also toppled Surak from the SCI/CMD catbird seat. Poor traits means he's not an auto-include, but is still serviceable as your rotational fifth (or fouth).

In short, Boothby's skill set makes him a great choice to break up SCI-centric walls in the gauntlet and, in combination with a huge stat total, makes him one of the best voyagers in the game. There are definite holes to Boothby's game - a lack of event work and unexciting arena prospects - and relative to the strength of newer cards, his bases are merely ok. But your gauntlet roster and especially voyage runs will no doubt benefit from this great daily use crew.
