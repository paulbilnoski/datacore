A great character from a great Deep Space Nine episode is woefully miscast as legendary Tuesday packbait. As a matter of fact, just listen to this from his episode instead of reading the note here, it'll be a better use of time for all of us.

Still here? Oh, you must want to know if he's worth chasing. Not really. Two practically identical 1.1k bases and the second highest two-skill voyage total look enticing, but unfortunately those are completely overwhelmed by the siege of other SEC/CMD options available. Sure, he could fill a CMD or SEC shuttle seat, but so can any number of other crew, and almost all of them are going to have more event or voyage utility, or both, than Vargas does. He may catch a stray event in the future, but it's more likely he will sit somewhere near the bottom of your roster never to be heard from again.
