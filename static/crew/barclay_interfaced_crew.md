There's a Broccoli/vegetable joke somewhere in hereâ€¦ Since his 2016 release, [_Mr. Broccoli_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JE-_S6tyLaE) has built up a lot of goodwill with his voyage work. But as the crew pool grows and his event work doesn't, there seem to be better options out there if you want to replicate his skill set credentials - Braxton for voyage power, Data for events, or Paris for rare skill set. Naturally we can't always pick and choose our crew and though he may not be as desirable a name as he previously was, he still offers some versatility for the average roster. Barclay owns a couple low ranked gauntlet pairs which, while not particularly strong, can be an asset at 1/5 for newer players. He won't pop up on the weekends very often, but is a viable voyage cog.
