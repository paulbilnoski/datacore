There's a Broccoli/vegetable joke somewhere in hereâ€¦ Since his 2016 release, Mr. Broccoli has built up a lot of goodwill with his voyage work. But as the crew pool grows and his event work doesn't, there seem to be better options out there if you want to replicate his skill set credentials - Braxton for voyage power, Data for events, or Paris for rare skill set. Naturally we can't always pick and choose our crew and though he may not be as desirable a name as he previously was, he still kicks in plenty of voyage ability for the average roster. He also has a couple ranked gauntlet pairs to his name which, while not particularly strong, can be a great asset at 1/5 for newer players. He won't pop up on the weekends very often, but is a viable voyage cog.
