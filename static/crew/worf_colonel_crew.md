Almost purely designed around the one thing that doesn't show up on sensors - the Cool Factor. He doesn't count as a variant of Worf, has no Gauntlet work, and while his ship ability kicks into gear at a snappy 7 seconds, it just doesn't feel competitive enough. Immortalising this voyage-only crew is mostly a project for collectors - he sports an excellent DIP base that you'll find handy for Klingon events, and he lands you a +1 Inspiring, but otherwise, don't be afraid to lay this one-scene wonder to rest in the freezer for most of the year.
