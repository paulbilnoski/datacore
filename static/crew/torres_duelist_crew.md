Unlikely to contribute on weekdays, Duelist is more of a luxury event pick with great collections, like most Torres variants. The #1 Torres SEC and #2 Torres/Klingon ENG is sure to be handy on occasion and she also has a handful of possible one-off event traits, such as athlete. There's theoretical gauntlet value for a pair rated at 83% of maximum, but with two average rolls, she will need both skills to line up and often performs better on paper than in game. With the Jury Rigger collection still needing a handful of legendaries, she may often be one of the best available choices for completionists while also contributing +1 to Innovator.
