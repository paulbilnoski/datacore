Unlikely to contribute on weekdays, Duelist is more of a luxury event pick with great collections, like most Torres variants. Both of her bases [_were recently topped_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Delta_Flyer_Torres), but she also has a handful of possible one-off event traits, [_such as athlete_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/The_Galactic_Series). There's theoretical gauntlet value for a pair rated at 83% of maximum, but with two average rolls, she will need both skills to line up and often performs better on paper than in game. With the Jury Rigger collection still needing a handful of legendaries, she may often be one of the better available choices for completionists while also contributing +1 to Innovator.
