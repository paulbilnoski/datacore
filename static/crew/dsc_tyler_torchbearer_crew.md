Hoo boy. Well, let's start off with the positives - for one, that cape. For another, Tyler grandfathers his way into a prodigious event count, and his bases are certainly serviceable if you missed a lot of the newer Discovery crew (#2 base SEC among the 4* crew). He's even useable in the Arena, with a somewhat slow but powerful straight Attack boost. And yet, he still falls short of his more well groomed brother, Lt. Tyler, missing his more desirable shuttle seating and his Pilot unlock, meaning that outside of that event work, he's not really going to be doing a lot for you that a lot of other cards can't. Added on top of this is the fact that we've officially entered the stage of the game where even a 1/5 can top a 4/4's contributions when it comes to event seating. As a result, you might find yourself struggling to justify sending this particular Torchbearer out on even requisition shuttles ahead of other, more versatile options.
