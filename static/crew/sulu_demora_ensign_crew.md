[_"I was never that young."_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GbKUVK_Ct0) No, you were younger - and more useful on a more consistent basis. With event chances worse than her father now that the Pilot mega has passed us by, about the only tangible benefit Demora has to offer you is a meaty top 10 base SEC. Pass.
