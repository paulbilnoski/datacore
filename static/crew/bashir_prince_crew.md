Fairly usable from several angles and excelling in niche situations, Prince Bashir was a giveaway crew late in 2018. If you have a copy (or two) of him from then, he's almost always going to be worth starring up via beholds. While nothing pops off the stat sheet, the secret sauce is his skill set. A CMD base 600 (!!) points better than the next variant all but guarantees him faction event work even from 1/5 and on voyages, he's in the top five for combined MED+CMD. Prince is a step or two below the sort of crew you'll want to spend honor on, but as a behold choice, he's firmly above average.
