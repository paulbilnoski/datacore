Stop me if you've heard this before: a new card is a very good ENG/SEC voyager with solid dual 1k bases and a decent event count. With Unsighted-but-Undaunted Tuvok making the fifth(!) new ENG/SEC card added in a six week stretch, they're starting to look pretty indistinguishable from each other. Tuvok does have a couple of things going for him, including the #1 Vulcan ENG base and the distinction of being the only Tuvok variant with ENG, but that won't necessarily contribute to a ton of weekend success, as Tuvok's event feature frequency is squarely in Uhura/Yar country, and there has not been a Vulcan event in over a year. Apart from a fairly milquetoast accuracy boost ship ability, there's not much else here. If you've missed out on the run of ENG/SEC crew up to this point, he's still a great add with strong daily use potential, but if you've already snagged a couple, Tuvok doesn't really bring enough else to the table to make him a must-add.
