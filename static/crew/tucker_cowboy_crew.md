NS Tucker is a blend of useful attributes and ineffective numbers. His best rank to be found, a top five ENG proficiency, translates into a top five ENG/DIP gauntlet pair behind some rather uncommon crew and at least gives his one bullet a chance to take down The Caretaker. Tucker's skill set used to command more use on voyages, but recent additions like mega Etana Jol have stolen some work from him. Between that and a pitiful voyage score, his days as a voyager are likely behind him on most rosters.

Trip has only recently hit a half dozen events, but NS Tucker has exactly the kind of traits that set the wheels turning in our mind. Romantic mega event in February? Costumed in October? A surprising amount of Tucker's value comes from his two exclusive collections. He's a must for Western, but almost equally so for Jury Rigger which in its current state requires a few legendary crew to complete and has a lot of bad options.
