I talked a few months ago about how valuable Jadzia is and AF Dax might be the best of the bunch. The #1 SCI and ENG bases for such a popular character is event-winning value and her #3 overall SCI will garner non-bonus event work every so often as well. Asking for more out of this card should be considered a bonus, but she's fairly usable elsewhere as well. Stout arena EV comes online fast enough to handle a lot of damage crew and although her voyage rank is into triple digits, it's only about 4% away from the top 40. Some Jadzias have a better reputation than they deserve, but it's because of elite crew like AF Dax who will more than pull her weight on your crew.
