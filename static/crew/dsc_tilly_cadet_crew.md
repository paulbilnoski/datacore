More variants are undoubtedly coming, but for now the Cadet owns two variant-best bases and one of the best Disco ENG stats. Unfortunately, variant events simply aren't happening and we've just received our third ENG primary mega crew. Still a useful event piece for as long as Disco mega months continue, but she's beginning to slip for daily use.
