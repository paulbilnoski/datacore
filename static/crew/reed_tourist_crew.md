Perhaps the epitome of genericness. Sporting no collections, a bland ship ability, uninspiring bases, only serviceable gauntlet pairs, and a voyage total that doesn't even try to impress, Reed's goofy art is about all that's notable about this filler fella. 5 events don't impress, either, when they're tied to the least popular Trek series. Perhaps I'll eat my words if we ever get that Romantic mega, but don't count on it.
