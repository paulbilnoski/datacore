If there is anything that I've learned from watching endless hours of Star Trek is that you should always bet on Jeffery Combs. He has the highest DIP stat across all 3* crew completely. His backup skills are high enough to make him the #1 voyage crew and can perform very well on sunday cadet missions. If you have a ship with the Position ability then his +4 attack AND +1250 to Crit will make short work of any enemy ships. Only shortcoming is no extra collections bonuses but that is so minor compared to his amazing skillset.
