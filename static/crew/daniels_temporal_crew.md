His time in the sun as #1 overall base SCI lasted the better part of a year - long enough to cultivate a reputation and it edges out notables like Leo da Vinci and Surak. Unfortunately for him, SCI bases have been hit hard by new crew in 2019 and despite having a fairly unique skill order (Beloved Annorax), his voyage score is hundreds of points behind the endless march of new crew. His traits are mostly event duds and with Undercover Operative as his best and only chance at multi-week relevance, you're better off trying to snag another SCI option who will stand out from the crowd, either by power or event opportunity.
