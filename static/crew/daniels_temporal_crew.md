His time in the sun as #1 overall base SCI lasted the better part of a year - long enough to cultivate a reputation. And still owning the best behold-able SCI base (ahead of mega Surak) is a feather in his cap. Unfortunately for him, SCI bases have been hit hard by new crew and despite having a unique skill order, his voyage score is hundreds of points behind the endless march of new crew. His traits are mostly event duds and with Undercover Operative as his best and only chance at multi-week relevance, you're better off trying to snag another SCI option who will stand out from the crowd, either by power or event opportunity.
