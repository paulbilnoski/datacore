His time in the sun as #1 overall base SCI lasted the better part of a year - long enough to cultivate a reputation. And still owning the best behold-able SCI base (ahead of mega Surak) is a feather in his cap. Though event bonuses will be few and far, far between, that sort of power is good enough for non-bonus Faction work. His voyage numbers aren't desirable due to poor proficiencies, but no other legendary shares his order of skills, allowing him to exploit certain niche voyages, even if SCI/ENG is a common pairing.
