Half of Captain Q's events have included shuttles, and two others were Galaxy event features (10x bonus) - a DIP base that sits behind only Mariachi Q among variants will warrant a thaw twice a year. Some voyage/gauntlet work is possible for fledgling rosters, but won't make a noticeable impact day to day apart from some fast, but replaceable arena evasion.
