Big Show's lone feature came during a mega event, of which none have been re-run to date. If you're considering him in a behold because he has three skills, don't. Any current event legendary at 1/5 or super rare at 4/4 offers hundreds more voyage points than Slaver does. His traits are depressing for event possibilities and voyage antimatter and he provides no peripheral perks. But don't feel bad for him...he won a stuffed animal from the fair and [_look how happy he is_](https://ladygeekgirl.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/the-big-show-paul-wight-orion-slaver-enterprise-borderland.jpg).
