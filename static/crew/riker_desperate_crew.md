[_He's not sure what to do with his hands_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqhkdHlCHLk), but with his third event of 2019, he pushes into double digit Riker weekends which makes Homeless Jazz Hands Riker's #4 CMD and #3 ENG bases among variants valuable event shuttle fillers. Newer rosters can make use of his viable CMD/ENG voyage stack and +6 attack booster at 6 seconds that kicks up to +9 if you manage the position trigger. Even adds a helpful +1 Veteran. For just one crew slot and 34 cents a day, you can help provide warmth and shelter for Rikers just like this one. Call now.
