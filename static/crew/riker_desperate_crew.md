He's not sure what to do with his hands, but with his second event of 2019, Riker now sits on the precipice of double-digit events, which makes Homeless Jazz Hands Riker's #4 CMD and #3 ENG bases among variants valuable event shuttle fillers, and newer rosters can make use of his decent CMD/ENG voyage pair and +6 attack booster at 6 seconds that kicks up to +9 if you manage the position trigger, and adds a helpful +1 Veteran. For just one crew slot and 34 cents a day, you can help provide warmth and shelter for Rikers just like this one. Call now.
