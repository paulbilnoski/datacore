[_Hello darkness my old friend_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYS0EeaAUMw) . . . well, if you're here, you've discovered that you, too, can pervert nature with transporter accidents. What do you get for your trouble? Well, you get an easy collection, ten traits, and a bit of an odd animal, honestly. Counting as a version of both Tuvok and Neelix, and netting you Vulcan faction bonuses, you'd be forgiven for thinking he's an event monster, but his bases simply don't support long term use. His Gauntlet pair is competitive in lower ranks, but will quickly lose potency - and a falling voyage total means he'll be quickly outclassed there, too. Depending on your flow of rare crew, you can have him fully fused without waiting for a pull or an event, and a good skill set means he's better than his numbers suggest, but in the end, he's bound for the freezer . . . or Captain Janeway's farm upstate.
