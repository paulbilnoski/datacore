One half of The Next Generation's attempt at alien sex appeal has very broad Diplomacy appeal (if you know what I mean). Being female and an alien gives her work all weekend on cadet missions and, like Neelix, can be merged with Lursa into the Duras Sisters, a 4* card with some worth in Arena and Gauntlet. Just remember to fully equip to level 99 (not 100) THEN fuse.
