Let's face it - [_you've gotta be a man to wear tights_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pc1am3KyYgA). Especially with this kind of confidence. But as your mother may have taught you, confidence isn't everything. His voyage numbers are likely going to hit triple digits in a few months, and he's a complete non-starter when it comes to Gauntlet, Arena or traits (by all means, prove me wrong with a Thief mega), this Littlest of Johns is first and foremost event crew. But that's no bad thing, especially when he comes with a free spot in a tricky to complete vanity collection - seriously, between pumping stars into this guy or Sheriff Q, I'd hope you know which is the better option - and a SEC base that will, undoubtedly, outperform any other Riker variant. That's about it, honestly; just another CMD/DIP/SEC Riker that you'll find useful, but not that useful. [_Enjoy a clip of Jonathan Frakes explaining the Darknet, in lieu of anything more interesting._](https://youtu.be/ToEiHXS2CmY)
