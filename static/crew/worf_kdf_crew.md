A SEC base for Worf/Klingon faction events. Someone who hogs a crew slot until his event is announced and you level him in the week beforehand. Fairly easy build if you've run the requisite amount of Klingon/KCA shuttles ahead of time. A 12 second 200% instant damage will keep him relevant on younger rosters, but it's fairly glacial pace will keep you looking for a replacement.
