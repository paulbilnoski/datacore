A SEC base for Worf/Klingon faction events and someone who hogs a crew slot until his event is announced and you level him in the week beforehand. His build is fairly easy if you've run the requisite amount of Klingon/KCA shuttles ahead of time. A 12 second 200% instant damage will keep him relevant on younger rosters, but it's not too difficult to find a quicker replacement.
