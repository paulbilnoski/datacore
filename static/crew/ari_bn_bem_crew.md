The numbers we show here in the doc are frankly flat and don't inspire confidence, so let's look at what Exodia _can_ do for your roster. A unique skill order and useful skill set puts a little oomph behind the voyage numbers and even though the lack of power will sink him sooner than later, he's certainly not the 158th-worst voyager in the game.

But it's the gauntlet where Mr. Bemjamin will make hay; a top five proficiency total, #2 SCI roll, and three ranked gauntlet pairs are all assets that you're likely to find very useful. He dodges Armus, his SCIperior, rather well, but there are a lot of big names at the top of the gauntlet power ranks and most have SCI, SEC, or both. His traits, which matter much more for the gauntlet than voyages in this case, have never recorded a crit value above 25%. That's a problem when almost all his surrounding competition can claim at least the occasional 45%+. He's a step down from monsters like Locutus, Caretaker, and Defensive Phlox, but the fact that he's even in the conversation with them is good news.
