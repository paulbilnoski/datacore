Sporting a dizzying #1 voyage SEC, [_Colonel Wai Lin's_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VrONsVIYI0) overall voyage total lags only behind Torchbearer Voq, riding at #2 overall, and has an event count that ticks all the right boxes, including Section 31, Mirror Universe, Discovery . . . she's everyone's favourite Empress (sorry Hoshi), even bringing a potent 200% instant damage ship ability to the table. The only thing keeping her out of the top tier is her skill set, but if you can only pick one CMD/DIP/SEC crew, this one is probably the one you should pick. This big base SEC is a card worth taking home to meet your mother. Just make sure you're cooking ganglia that night.
