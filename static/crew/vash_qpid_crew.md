The ultimate "process over results" card. Even though she snuck into two recent mega events (one only after DB added traits to over a dozen crew just to make the event viable), [_a crew can have traits_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Martia) on the weekend, [_but that don't make 'em good_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzhrCg9To14&t=25). She may indeed catch more handfuls of bonuses, but as we're learning, trying to bet on specific traits for events can be a fool's errand. Until the Dabo wheel of events calls her number, she offers extremely poor return on investment for daily play and her best perk remains a spot in a vanity collection.
