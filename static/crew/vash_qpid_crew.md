The ultimate "process over results" card. Even though she snuck into a recent mega event, it was only after DB added traits to over a dozen crew just to make the event viable. She may indeed catch more handfuls of bonuses from Costumed or Scoundrel, but as her mega event showed, trying to bet on specific traits for events can be a fool's errand. Until the Dabo wheel of events calls her number, she offers extremely poor return on investment for daily play and her best perk remains a spot in a vanity collection.
