Outside of an occasional gauntlet fifth, the Regent is unlikely to be of use for you day to day. Where he shines, however, is in the two scoops of events he's been bonus for with traits that support further regular weekend work. Taking stars for a crew with such poor daily stats is often hard to justify, but the frequency with which you can use him on weekends is among the best in the game.
