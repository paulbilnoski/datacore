Something of a disappointment all around, Smuggler Kasidy is in the unenviable position of having people say that she has a CMD and ENG base "in the top 50!" as if that's going to do much to soften the blow of such a thoroughly middle-of-the-road-crew. Her best shot at event relevance came and went (Pilot), and unless we're looking at a Smuggler mega (ha), the only thing she has to offer is +1 Jury Rigger. Tricky collection that needs all the 4* it can get, but outside of that, you can do better than pack-only offerings like this.
