Both of Shran's features have overlapped with Andorian events and that number is likely to slow with the Andorian mega behind us. His numbers would need a much rarer skill set to garner any voyage work, which leaves the arena as his chance for a regular contribution. Above average passive numbers meet six second attack power and even though he needs a number of stars to avoid having to use a supplementary attack crew, Jeffery Combs fans usually have no problem collecting stars on his many wonderful characters.
