Call him Delta Flyer Paris Version 2.0. As North Face Knee Brace Mayweather is the second legendary crew to have a CMD/ENG/MED skill set, the comparison is unavoidable. Mayweather's bases and voyage prowess thoroughly outclass Ol' Speed Racer, with a CMD base that slots in right between perennial stalwarts Commander Kira and Borg Queen, elite company to be sure. Unfortunately, Mayweather's event chances are about as forgotten as Mayweather himself was on Enterprise, as he is tied with the likes of Barclay, Vic Fontaine and Wesley bleepin' Crusher in variant features, and hasn't had his name called since 2017. A Pilot mega and Athlete one-off prop up that paltry total, but make no mistake, his future weekend outlook is poor. That won't matter much if you're lucky enough to get him in a pack, as you'll be too busy plugging him into voyage after voyage, and Paris can finally start thumbing through the Power Creep Acres brochure you gave him months ago.
