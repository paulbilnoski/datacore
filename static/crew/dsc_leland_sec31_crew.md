Fairly vanilla crew. His two areas of interest are in the arena and events. A chunk of damage at eight seconds without a trigger is just peachy for skirmishes and many arena situations. And though I won't pretend to know how Discovery will play out in the future, there's no denying that the Disco and SEC 31 traits have not only been among the most valuable to date, but are likely to be so going forward.
