The goddess of Cadets. One of "Riker's Angels" and just all around awesome. If you pick her up quick enough you will have completed about 50% of the difficult missions. She can work on all three cadet missions all week. Her CMD stat is strong for a 2* and her ship ability will make short work combined with an attack boost. She lacks a collection but frankly she stands alone in being one of the best crewmembers you will ever use.
