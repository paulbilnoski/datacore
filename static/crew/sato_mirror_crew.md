We're doing a kindness listing the voyage score for the worst CMD/DIP/SEC super rare voyager in the game, but it doesn't belong as a tool on your roster, nor her boarding damage or weak gauntlet numbers. [_The Empress_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUt46weEzpk) also had the misfortune of two overlapping Sato and Mirror events, not that it would have made a huge difference. Her DIP is still good enough to pop for one or two event shuttles per year, but a [_Professor_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Professor_Sato) in the hand is worth 2.18 in the Mirror Universe.
