Tempted was ironically the Soong prototype for all the ENG primary Datas that have come after him. In his heyday he was special and even though Father Time is undefeated, Tempted still has some juice in his legs yet. Due to the logjam among Datas in the ENG base ranks, Tempted will perform similarly to other variants for his numerous events. ENG/DIP additions to the game have unfortunately caused his sinking voyage score to feel more accurate, but that same skill set also helps him maintain two mid-level gauntlet pairs. As well rounded as the day he was activated, just with a notch or three less power relative to the field.
