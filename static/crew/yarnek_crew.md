Having cut his teeth in the gauntlet, Yarnek has been somewhat rudely excused from there, first by the ubiquitous Surak and now even more so by current gauntlet reward Armus. His #4 SCI/CMD pair is still a boon to newer players, but he's as likely to face 40% win chance walls as any other crew. The reason you'll want him is for voyages where in combination with a useful skill set, he's strong enough to make runs for most roster.
