Spock is good for the soul. A consistent event performer with multiple features in each of the past three years and as many or more trait events piled on top. Yet instead of Spock overload, everyone seems happy each time he comes around. It's impressive, then, that with his long and storied history in STT, and with deference to Gangster's gauntlet service, Mountaineer Spock is the best version yet. Dual 1k bases for variant events sit close enough behind the leaders that his three #2s are even better than they might seem. He's also the #2 option for SCI+CMD voyage runs behind the indomitable FO Burnham and double digit traits help enhance both his seating there and some considerable event chances. If your roster needs a boost, strap on a pair of rocket boots and let Mountaineer give you a hand.
