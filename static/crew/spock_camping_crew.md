Spock is good for the soul. A consistent event performer with multiple features in each of the past three years and as many or more trait events piled on top. Yet instead of Spock overload, [_everyone seems happy each time he comes around_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkVQnZ3xndI). Big brother Sci Officer Spock may have stolen a bit of shine from Mountaineer's bases and voyage work, but he's still a top three option for both Spock events and SCI/CMD voyage runs where double digit traits help enhance his seating there and some considerable event chances. If your roster needs a boost, [_strap on a pair of rocket boots and let Mountaineer give you a hand_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PRxN-KNqLs&t=247).
