Spock is good for the soul. A consistent event performer with multiple features in each of the past three years and as many or more trait events piled on top. Yet instead of Spock overload, everyone seems happy each time he comes around. Big brother Sci Officer Spock may have stolen a bit of shine from Mountaineer's bases and voyage work, but he's still a top three option for both Spock events and SCI/CMD voyage runs where double digit traits help enhance his seating there and some considerable event chances. If your roster needs a boost, strap on a pair of rocket boots and let Mountaineer give you a hand.
