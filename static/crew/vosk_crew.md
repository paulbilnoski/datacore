Nazis. I hate these guys. What I don't hate, however, is a CMD/ENG voyager with stats as purdy as this fellow. A top 10 CMD base, top 10 voyage numbers, and a relatively unique skill set elevate Vosk beyond his one-off status. Perhaps not particularly eventable, but for daily use, you're going to be hard pressed to find someone who offers quite what he does within even spitting distance of this potency - the next best CMD/ENG crew are Smuggler Kasidy Yates and Commander Barclay, nearly 50 voyage ranks away.
