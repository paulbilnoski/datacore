First things first; yes, cite her if you can. Outside of her mega, Janeway will continue perform well on voyages, shuttles, and weekends for a long time to come, so she is well worth the investment, and stacks up well alongside the rest of the numerous ENG/SEC crew options DB has released recently. In particular, she is an almost exact copy of Delta Flyer Torres, down to an identical voyage score. Where the other crew cannot match her, however, is collections, where DB has done all of us a tremendous favor and given Janeway the all-important Jury Rigger trait, along with Veteran, should you need it.

Janeway's events have slowed down considerably over the last year and a half, but two features so far in 2019 give hope that things may be changing there. That's good news, because her Survivalist Kirk-like monopoly on ENG for Janeway variants will give her a huge advantage over the field. If you're looking for downsides, Janeway brings nothing to the Gauntlet, and her ship ability makes her little more than a hull-repairing warm body for Skirmishes, but these are trivial compared to everything else she brings to the table. She may come from a year she'd like to forget, but Determined Janeway is built for the long haul and will make a lasting impression on your roster.
