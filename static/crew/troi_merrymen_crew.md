Diplomacy at the end of an...arrow? If you've seen the episode (or Friar Tuck Data's artwork) Merry Men Troi comes from, you know that simply having a bow and arrow does not an archer make, but what this card makes is a powerhouse that bests one of the best Archers in the game, in this case Humbled Archer. Comparing the two, Troi trades a slightly lower DIP base (which is still variant-best by a wide margin) for significantly higher MED and CMD bases, which translates to her taking over as the #1 DIP/MED voyage option and puts her just behind Archer for MED/CMD, despite both of them being DIP primaries. Her weekend chances are strong as well, as a double-digit event count and strong bases give her more chances to find seats where other Troi variants won't. For the crit boosting fans out there, Troi's ship ability has you covered, though the attack boost that comes along with it is pretty paltry and a tad slow, but all that is just icing on the cake for a card that is as rock-solid as they come.
