Another card I have some conflicting views on. Her SCI stats are pretty poor, in fact she has lowest SCI primary base stat for a 3* card. But combined with her other skills she actually does quite well on voyages and she can work all weekend cadet missions. Her ship ability isn't bad if you have a vessel with a cloak. The unusual combination of SCI/DIP/CMD at less-than-average scores gives her plenty of use in voyages but outside of that she's pretty lackluster.
