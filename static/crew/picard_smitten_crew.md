It's a fool's errand to guess future events (Pilot mega, really?), but you can't tell me Meme Picard wouldn't look great as the poster boy for a February "Romantic" mega. In the here and now, Smitten is fine event crew with two shuttle-quality bases and an event count we can work with. Picard-mania swept through Timelines with a Happy Picard Day mailbox gift, campaign [_"Inspired by the recent Star Trek: Picard teaser"_](https://forum.disruptorbeam.com/stt/discussion/13946/june-campaign-announcement#latest), and a future television show which should only help his variants out on the weekend. His spot in the Inspiring collection still has value and may be a behold tie-breaker as his star count rises. For a bit of added daily value, consider his arena damage at an ultra-rare nine seconds; slower than some, but fast enough to catch crew like T'kuvma sleeping.
