Don't judge a card by the haircut his mom gave him when he was six (was 1996 just like that?). The skill set and handicapped arena work are [_bummers_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N32ZTPtD9AM), but this card is a fine voyage piece if you have him fused and in tandem with Chakotay event work picking up after a gargantuan drought, the era of trait megas should garner him a fistful or two of bonuses down the line. Milquetoast to be sure, but if you employ him for what he is rather than what he isn't, he's a fine roster component to keep stashed.
