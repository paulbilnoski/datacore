For some inexplicable reason, this pacifist Odo has the second best base SEC among Odos...you know, _the Security Chief?!_ His DIP base is fine for daily shuttles and he sports fairly relevant dual bases for Odo's two events per year, but is a luxury event pick who only grants value after paying merits for his services.
