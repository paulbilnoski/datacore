No, you haven't wandered into the Super Rare crew, those are Gangster's actual stat ranks. Yet somehow he manages to dodge those poor numbers and contribute. First and foremost, he's well known in the gauntlet. Despite taking a beating there from recent crew additions, he still owns the #2 SEC/ENG ranked pair (three pairs total) on the strength of his #1 overall SEC proficiency.

His SEC is also worthwhile for events where a good-for-super-rare number meets reliable event chances. Eleven traits are useful for triggering bonuses of all sorts for events, voyages, and gauntlet crit. Though I can't recommend that the average player invest more than one star, he triggers the difficult Jury Rigger collection when fused. If you add stars to him for that reason and/or events, his return on investment may not match other crew, but a useful skill set is likely to garner him some work outside the gauntlet.
