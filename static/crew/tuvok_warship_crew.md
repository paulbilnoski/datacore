Thanks to a slew of traits including two megas, Warship has hit twenty bonus events which gives him plenty of chances to anchor your shuttles or even sneak in a Galaxy crafting node here and there. His top 10 SEC rank may not be the catbird seat, but it's closer to #1 than it would be for any other skill and SEC is the most common Faction seat; a good place to sit his #1 Vulcan SEC. A nice chunk of arena instant damage may not be worth it for everyone because of a trigger requirement that doesn't appear on Dabo-able ship, but still packs enough punch and is certainly thematic.
