Main cast crew with the mirror trait (and the accompanying Terran Empire/Brutal) always have at least a bit of value. Tack on a couple event features and she's a usable, if uninspiring, cryo vault thaw candidate. Also notable are usable arena acc/crit and a middling gauntlet pair for her only chances at daily use.
