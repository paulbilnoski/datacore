Data's variants in Timelines are a fascinating study. They're both quite similar and yet Rock, Paper, Scissors at the same time. Having looked at what each offers, it's tempting to call Pinafore the best of the bunch. A #1 variant ENG, usable CMD, and second best voyage total at the very least have him near the top of the pack, even if he's missing the trait benefits that a handful of others have. If there was [_an awards show_](https://old.reddit.com/r/StarTrekTimelines/comments/aq90e4/the_first_annual_timelines_event_awards_event/) for Timelines crew, Data would certainly win "safest bet". Close your eyes and throw at a dartboard of Datas and you'll never come away disappointed.
