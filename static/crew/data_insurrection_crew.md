Data's variants in Timelines are a fascinating study. They're both quite similar and yet Rock, Paper, Scissors at the same time. Having looked at what each offers, it's tempting to call Pinafore the best of the bunch. A #1 variant ENG, usable CMD, and second best voyage total at the very least have him near the top of the pack, even if he's missing the trait benefits that a handful of others have. Data's perennial event work and an ENG/CMD stack safely inside the top ten voyagers help buoy otherwise unimpressive stat totals. Close your eyes and throw at a dartboard of Datas and you'll never come away disappointed.
