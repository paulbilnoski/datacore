If you're here, it's either because you're wondering if Lucy is worth immortalizing all those collection crew or your Elusive Treasures behold made you go "huh, I didn't know I could get her from beholds". First, the crew. Janeway events had fallen off a cliff and come flying out the other side of the earth. But then in the 14th month of her drought, we finally struck oil. With her events picking back up at a respectable clip, her strong DIP will be an asset and a couple eventable traits (Where is Caretaker?!) may add some surprise value. With #100 being the new average on voyages, Lucy is at least competent there, if unspectacular.

Is she worth the collection effort? If your focus is performance, then no. Odo and Kim are rarely crew you want to take a star of in any circumstance, let alone being worth citations. The other four crew are solid-to-great and so if you're sitting with a 3/5 Lucy and she pops in an Elusive Treasures pack, then that may save you a huge chunk of honor if you desire her.

New build-a-bear Evolved Janeway has pipped Lucy for the #1 Janeway DIP. With Holodeck Enthusiasts being a much higher asking price than fusing some unwanted spare crew, it's best to think of Lucy as a nice bonus rather than someone to focus on acquiring or spending honor on.
