EV Suit keeps alive the time-honored tradition of Sevens flying the gauntlet flag alongside terrible bases. But unlike the more well known, rifle wielding Seven, and despite a strong SCI roll, neither of her gauntlet pairs are likely to fetch much loot for you without a hefty crit match. They're of middling power and buried behind walls of gauntlet favorites and exclusives, including an influx of heavy hitters from a mid-2019 portal update. EV Suit's bases are in even bigger trouble with a SECondary stuck in the mud behind a desirable 4/4 variant and her SCI primary lagging behind newer global gift Seven in Silver. 

Ironically a woeful voyage total might be her best contribution to your squad as it consists of a chunk of SCI/SEC which is almost always in short supply. If you're looking to snag a Seven, it's advisable to pivot to the gauntlet capable Seven of Nine or newer base-happy Seven in Silver.
