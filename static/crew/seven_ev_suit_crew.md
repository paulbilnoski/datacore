EV Suit keeps alive the time-honored tradition of Sevens flying the gauntlet flag alongside terrible bases. But unlike the more well known rifle wielding Seven and despite a strong SCI roll, neither of her gauntlet pairs are likely to fetch much loot for you. They're of middling power and buried behind walls of gauntlet favorites and exclusives. EV Suit's bases are in even bigger trouble with a SECondary stuck in the mud behind a desirable 4/4 variant and her SCI primary lagging behind newer global gift Seven in Silver.

Ironically a woeful voyage total might be her best contribution on your squad as it consists of a chunk of SCI/SEC which is almost always in short supply. If you're looking to snag a Seven, it's advisable to pivot to the gauntlet capable Seven of Nine or new base-happy Seven in Silver.
