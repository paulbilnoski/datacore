A unique dual-eligible crew, Data Q qualifies for both of those variants' events. Going forward, that means that he's the #2 SCI base for both characters and has collected a significant event tally to date. His five second attack trigger on ships is likely to be overrated as he's clearly the class of the options for his debut Skirmish event, but you typically don't have to look too far to find similar or better options. With little of interest on the periphery, Data Q is merely fine for daily play, but should be costing you bundles of merits to thaw for Faction events down the line.
