Finally a portal update has brought competition for the [_Queen_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZkouut-9RQ&t=66). If you're not gung-ho about Faction events, Gary Seven also offers otherworldly daily value. Luckily, we're allowed to use more than one crew in Timelines and Burnham remains one of the top shelf elite, even after two years. One of the most delicious base/event pairings that the game has to offer meets tremendous voyage power and even some late-activating shipboard damage for newer players. If she graces your behold, take her and cite her - no questions asked. [_As Billy Ocean said, "She's simply awesome."_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f16Fw_K45s&t=10)
