Stop smiling at me like that, you're creeping me out. New and improved Happy Annorax outdoes standard issue Annorax statistically, but that doesn't do much to escape his fate as a non-event voyager with little else to speak of. His overall total and #2 SCI/ENG voyage combo are nice, even if it is a somewhat common pairing, and his bases can certainly pitch in on non-bonus daily shuttles as needed. Get away from that, and it's zeroes all the way down the line for Arena, Gauntlet and collections. This Annorax is a lover, not a fighter, so if he ends up sitting on your bench for a while, he won't make much of a fuss.
