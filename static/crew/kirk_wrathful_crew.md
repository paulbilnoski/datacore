Abandon thine cynicism, all ye who enter. In the vein of Gary Seven or Surak, DB has done us all a solid and given this Trek icon some serious muscle. Let's start at the top where Kirk's #1 voyage SEC by a healthy margin helps him claim a strong voyage score in a common, but not too common skill set. If you're one to deep dive your voyage planning, he's the top voyager for his skill order and one of only two in the top 100.

He's also a no-brainer on the weekend where his overall lead for variant events (14) meets some future trait mega possibilities. His SEC rank is certainly shiny and even though it's in the same neighborhood as the popular Rura Penthe variant, is still undeniable on every day of the week. His other bases are enhancement tools; a low CMD secondary helps give him a top five 'SEC and CMD' score for that extremely common shuttle seat and his ENG makes him the second variant behind Survivalist Kirk to offer that skill for event flexibility.

Kirk's also interesting on ships thanks to a 30% attack speed boost that only a small number of crew offer in that amount. It activates 40% faster than any of the others, which is just what you need to give it time to make a difference - definitely helpful for hunting your rivals 'round the moons of Nibia. Saddle up, lock and load your shuttle boosts. Time to help Kirk hunt down that Bloodsucker Khan.
