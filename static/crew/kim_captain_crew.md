Kim fans, I know you're out there. Congratulations on a competent in-game representation. Before this variant came along, the best use we usually got out of his five outfits was an easy breezy one star crew build to spam for the dilithium achievement. This time around Cap'n Kid brings more power to his game, even if it won't knock your socks off. Useful shuttle numbers that can hang with anyone outside the top five and two of those bases are also variant-best for his modest, but consistent handful of events. On voyages there are a couple familiar faces above him in the ranks (Braxton, La Borg), but his numbers are good enough to make him one of the top CMD/ENG options and a reliable cog, even if his benefits are somewhat narrow.
