Doctornate Future Ann Daxhall immediately drew comparisons to AF Jadzia for her big SCI base, but there's no way that trading Dax's prodigious event count for a base improvement of less than 1% can be seen as anything but a downgrade. Mulhall's traits are a notch less useful as well with perhaps only Explorer in line to snag future weekend bonuses. Thankfully she compensates with more voyage power in a skill set which is no longer uncommon, but is more useful with much of its representation not yet in the portal. If we break with the Jadzia comparisons and checklist the corners of this crew, Mulhall offers very little in the way of fringe or luxury benefits, but will perform well as a stout base/voyage crew for daily use and hits the right note for non-bonus Faction shuttles.
