For a card so old (Mid 2016), [_McCoy has held up remarkably well_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XJ7dhofvhY). DA has a rather flat stat distribution; sort of like a primary and two secondaries. For that reason, his MED is not noteworthy even if his work for MED/SEC voyages is. He also has three bases good enough for event shuttles starting at 4/5 and four event features to his name. Considering the universal lack of MED crew and such poor stats on the gauntlet focused ones, DA McCoy is a worthwhile pickup for any roster.
