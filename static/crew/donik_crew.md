Ol' Dino Donik here might have an impressively high ENG base but his poor DIP stat means his voyage potential is lacking. His ship ability will prove useful combined with attack boosts but a lack of traits means that he is a pretty generic engineer. Still if you are lacking in ENG crew then he's certainly not the worst crew to have.
