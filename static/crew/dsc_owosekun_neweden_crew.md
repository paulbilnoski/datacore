NEO is a crew without holes. If we accept that only a very few crew hold esteemed spots in the gauntlet _and _shuttle rankings _coughGarycough_ then we're glad to welcome aboard the new #1 Discovery super rare SEC without reservation. The Disco mega [_freight train is only picking up speed_](https://i2.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/emergence6.jpg?resize=475%2C363&type=vertical) and Owo will be manning shuttles there several times a year if you can spare her from her voyage duties. SEC/SCI doesn't have strong representation among legendary crew and so her satisfactory power there meets a useful skill set for some pre-freezer work on early to mid-game rosters. Her arena numbers speak of Ardra-lite usability for new players and a spot in a stat-boosting collection is the cherry on top.
