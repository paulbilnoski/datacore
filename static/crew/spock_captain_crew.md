There were many lamentations that the iconic movie Spock wasn't give the stats to back up his on-screen gravitas, but he's still plenty serviceable any day of the week. CMD/SCI voyager options have been more fleshed out recently, but several of them are not yet in the portal. With rank 100 being the new average, Spock can certainly hold his own there if you choose to invest in him for event or emotional reasons. On the topic of events, Spock's heady event count meets his traditional two scoops of traits for a voyage antimatter boost or stray weekend bonus. There are already several superior SCI options among variants, but his CMD base is #1 and likely will have no trouble pitching in on Spock-flavored weekends.
