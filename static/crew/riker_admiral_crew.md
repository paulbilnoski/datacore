Still as condescending as ever to the cadets, Admiral Riker no longer has the bite to back up his bark. The old gauntlet powerhouse has been relegated to new player asset where a middling event count, bland skill set, and poor numbers combine to make a frankly boring card. The Pilot mega may have given him relevance on some rosters, but with few other eventable traits, it's not controversial to say that his best days are behind him.
