An impressive event count between three features, Quark events, and several trait opportunities, but only his DIP base (637) is usable and not all that impressive. With pathetic numbers across the board and the common skill set, he won't immediately pay off a very expensive build consisting of a mish-mash of Klingon and Ferengi faction items, 70 Klingon house crests, and the highest chroniton requirement of 4* crew. You'll eventually want him for the Ferengi collection and a load of event work, but getting him to FF/FE just to shove him into the freezer is a calculated venture for rosters that have resources to burn. If not for his legendarily irritating build cost, he would be a plus investment for most players.
