Another Data, another stalwart. A base/event pairing you can set your watch by and a useful voyage stack that's effective beyond a subpar ranking. On ships, his ability and start time line up nicely for players looking to blast through Skirmish battles. Ask anyone who owns him and they'll tell you he's as reliable as they come.
