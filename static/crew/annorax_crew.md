Red Forman ain't too bad for a non-event crew. He's a top ten SCI/CMD voyager who, for a comparison to a more common crew, is similar to Armus there with better SCI and overall numbers. The top of the SCI base charts have historically been light on event crew so if you're looking for shuttle help who can pitch in elsewhere, he's not a bad investment thanks to several potential future mega traits. If Annorax is unlucky, however, you're looking at ever-sinking stat totals without the benefit of events to buoy him.
