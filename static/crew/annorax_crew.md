Red Forman ain't bad at all for a non-event crew. He's comfortably a top ten SCI/CMD voyager and for a comparison to a more common crew, he's similar to Armus there, but with better SCI and overall numbers. The top of the SCI base charts have historically been light on event crew so if you're looking for shuttle help who can pitch in elsewhere, he's not a bad investment thanks to several potential future mega traits.
