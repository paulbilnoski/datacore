When I started playing Timelines, I had one goal: gather enough resources to buy Kahless before he left the Honor Hall. The chase was worth it for me and most players tend to agree. In the gauntlet, he owns the #1 CMD proficiency and still has a lock on a #1 gauntlet pair (4 overall), though crit numbers may fudge the math from time to time. Thankfully, Kahless can bring plenty of crit strength to bear as well with occasional 65% gauntlets. Power creep and lizards are the only things that travel faster than warp 10, so it's remarkable that this nearly two year old crew can still claim such great numbers on voyages.

His skill set has scared off some players from spending honor on him, but the window is probably still open a little while longer on it being a break-even or good investment to fuse him up since you don't have to worry about seeing him in beholds. If you do feed him citations, you'll also own a top five Klingon CMD base for about one weekend bonus per year. Many players have choked on the price for his first star and the longer that Timelines carries on, the harder it is to say he's definitively a good investment, more so that he  _has_  been. Who would have thought a non-event, CMD/DIP/SEC crew would have aged as well as he has? In either case, he remains a wonderfully valuable choice; another option for your honor.
