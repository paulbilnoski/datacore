Mega legendaries are always a sticky topic. If you're just ducking in to see if it's worth adding the last star; you probably won't regret it. He's very similar to former mega Kortar and if you read up on him, you'll hear, "Solid, but nothing spectacular." So, too, is Kol. If you're a new player, give him the honor. It'll be a great boost for several facets of the game and is an efficient point-per-honor way of collecting stats to further your gameplay. If you have options, however, Kol is not a particularly special crew. His best attribute is the Disco trait whose events he'll excel in thanks to the #3 Disco SEC base. Without variants, collections, or a more useful skill set, he may not age well as a behold choice in the future, but as long as the Disco events continue Kol will be a fine contributor.
