Mega legendaries are always a sticky topic. If you're just ducking in to see if it's worth adding his last star; that window has passed. He's very similar to former megas Kortar and Thrax and if you read up on them, you'll hear, "Solid, but nothing spectacular." So, too, is Kol. Timelines has a way of providing more of Kol's skill set than you'll ever need, so if you're looking for unique offerings and small edges, look elsewhere. His best attribute is the Disco trait whose events he'll excel in thanks to a top five Disco SEC base. Without variants, collections, or a more useful skill set, he may not age well as a behold choice in the future, but as long as the Disco events continue Kol will be an alright contributor.
