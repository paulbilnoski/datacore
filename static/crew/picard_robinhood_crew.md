A big SEC base, handful of events, and top 1/3rd voyage numbers will keep him busy on most rosters and a vanity collection spot is a nice post-fusion perk. Plus pencil mustaches are making a comeback. The skill set is a bummer and will get him replaced more quickly than others on voyages, but his shuttle work should endure and is looking at an uptick in usefulness with a Picard TV show knocking on our door.
