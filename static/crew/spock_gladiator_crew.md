Combining so many strong facets of a card, this Spock ends up [_smelling as sweet as honey_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gzt2t4nmOg&t=48). Double digit traits have created _double_, double digit event chances and give him excellent utility for both voyage antimatter and future event bonuses. His base SEC is leagues ahead of the next best Spock option who happens to be someone players rarely immortalize; one-star wonder Gangster Spock. He can handle his variants' competition with a single star and in many cases will be the easy choice over super rares to win your favor for shuttle seating. In combination with prodigious weekend work, his gun (sword, I guess) will be called upon fairly frequently.

Gladiator is just as brawny on voyages where a sizable raw total meets an oft-needed skill set to make him the #2 SEC/SCI voyager behind the much ballyhooed Gary Seven and one of just three in the top 100. Only Trelane shares his diplomatic (tertiary) bent among legendary crew, so rest assured that his voyage work is safe for quite a while. Piddly proficiency numbers and middling arena work are available for the glass-half-empty crowd to critique, but his owners will be too busy using him regularly to care.
