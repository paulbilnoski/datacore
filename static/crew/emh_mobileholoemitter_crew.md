The former MED base leader is in danger of falling out of the top ten. On voyages, the numbers speak for themselves in a way that even a handy skill order has trouble saving. But a crew with sinking effectiveness in all corners, [_was thrown a lifeline_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4m6RqDkeI4) in the form of Fusion-palooza! As a standalone card he still has event value, but as a catalyst to create the ultra useful Indulgent Seven, [_he has new life_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsJB_EdUDWo). Despite Father Time bearing down on him, Mobile Doc is still a handy card to come across at the behold screen.

> Perhaps the fusion crew with the most nuance to unpack, Mobile Doc's value went haywire with the addition of Indulgent Seven. On one hand, being fusible into a superior card is undeniable value both for crew strength and immortal safety at the behold screen. On the other hand, fusing Doc may really only be cost-efficient the first time since you're paying a 1/5 and 4/4 for another 1/5. On the third Edosian hand, the new Seven is a better and more popular option for Doc event MED, which was Mobile's last true strength. On the Terellian fourth hand, we may see an uptick in Doc events based on the circulation of recent television news. Since tiers are made up anyways, Doc moves up a tick for some increased versatility at the cost of a bit more event competition.
