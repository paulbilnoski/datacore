OwO what's this? Another SCI/CMD Discovery crew with a handsome voyage total and a top ten base? No, you're not looking at another Disco Spock, this is just a common garden variety bridge crew character. Best paired with her BFF Detmer for side-glancing action, Joann helps carry that great Star Trek tradition of multiple character reaction shots to let you know when things are serious into the twenty first century. Comparisons with Dr. Ann Mulhall and Science Officer Spock are immediate, and very much warranted, but there's a pretty big divide between them - events. 

You can either have that big ol' base but the event count of a  [_body at the bottom of an elevator shaft_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj8FIbuoWPY) ; a few points less but the distinction of being, you know,  [_Spock_](https://youtu.be/eVDMDyDTsLs?t=79) ; or Owosekun, who sits pretty fairly in the middle, with the lesser base and less chance of getting her Faction ticket called, but a better overall voyager than either. She's fine crew, with a voyage number that pops, but how gracefully it and she will age is the million dollar question. Assuming we get another Discovery mega, she'll be your third best SCI/CMD option, which is, bizarrely, a compliment, but even assuming we don't, you're still looking at a stalwart voyager with a nice Veteran glaze, though I expect that by the time you're Immortalising Discovery bridge crew that aren't Burnham, you're unlikely to need that +1.
