Perhaps the least well known of Jeffrey Combs' many faces, this scoundrel has the worst event chances (1 Brutal), but respectable overall utilIty. Between a 200% instant damage attack and a top 10 ENG base, he certainly has the stats to justify daily use, though older rosters may find themselves freezing him sooner rather than later. If he's lucky, one of his fanny-pack's worth of traits will end up being the next surprise mega theme. Otherwise - that's Tsunkatse, baby.
