Ushaan's bases are...problematic, but at least in the back half of 2018 DB remembered he exists and so he should have an occasional chance to make them relevant in the future. Equally poor are voyage numbers that have a view of several 2-skillers breathing down his neck. The best we can hope for there is a bit of help on a SEC deficient roster. His two most useful attributes are a SEC proficiency just outside the top ten and a [_tough node unlock_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Serious_Business). His strengths make him most valuable as a one star proposition, rather than an investment.
