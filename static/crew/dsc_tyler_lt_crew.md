His 800+ SEC base may earn some shuttle play on the average roster, but it's in combination with his events where it shines. Disco and Klingon (spoiler alert) trait events in addition to any variant bonuses give him the potential to make a splash for several weeks in a row. One of only a few crew to offer the [_Pilot/SEC node unlock_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Serious_Business).
