Repent, sinner! Or the minister may perform an exorcism on you with his osmotic eels. The first thing you should know about the Rev is that among legendary crew, only he and Captain Beverly Picard have MED and CMD as their top two skills. Which means that for certain voyage configurations, he's not just a great option, he's the only option. Job security is tremendously valuable for cards and gives you less to worry about in the face of power creep, but what would Rev mean to your roster?

Take a look at his two skill sum for voyages. Crews ranked 5-9 all have voyage totals #150 or lower and Captain Bev is going to cost you a huge chunk of honor just to get her first copy aboard your ship. Rev's WAR stat, or the difference in power between him and an average MED/CMD replacement, is monstrous and in most cases even better than ENG/MED crew and other rare combos. His offerings outside of voyages are a step down, but still quality. A top five gauntlet pair, three variant-best bases for a modest number of events, strong six second arena EV, and a good "MED and CMD" shuttle score. If you want to build a well-rounded roster or boost your weakest area, Phlox is your man.
