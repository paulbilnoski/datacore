Repent, sinner! Or the minister may perform an exorcism on you with his osmotic eels. The first thing you should know about the Rev is that among legendary crew, only he, Dr. Pollard, and Captain Beverly Picard have MED and CMD as their top two skills. Which means that for certain voyage configurations, he's not just a great option, he's the only option. Job security is tremendously valuable for cards and gives you less to worry about in the face of power creep, but what would Rev mean to your roster?
   
[_Take a look at his two skill sum for voyages._](https://i.imgur.com/SuVL7O5.png)  Between crummy voyage totals, an expensive honor hall option, and  [_shining Pollard far from portal_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8zPSNNsHBI), the minister is your best bet to pump up a very difficult voyage combo. Rev's  [_WAR stat_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement) , or the difference in power between him and an average MED/CMD replacement, is monstrous and in most cases even better than ENG/MED crew and other rare combos. His offerings outside of voyages are a step down, but still quality. A top five gauntlet pair,  _three _ variant-best bases for a modest number of events, strong six second arena EV, and a good "MED and CMD" shuttle score. If you want to build a well-rounded roster or boost your weakest area, Phlox is your man.
