Typically collections are the cherry on top for 5* crew. It's a long road from behold to FF and the value needs to be there to make it worth the resources. But in Borgres Assres Klingborg Torass' case, she hits on two of the more difficult stat-boosting collections. They're not a dealbreaker, or dealmaker in this case, but it's worth considering. Outside of that, she's standard shuttle crew with an above average event count thanks to Klingon and Borg traits and is the #1/#3 base ENG for those traits respectively. She doesn't come online for daily use before 3/5 on most rosters, but as you may have gathered already, she's a long-term investment.
