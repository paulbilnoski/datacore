Another Skirmish, another SCI crew. If you've collected some of the other half dozen top ten SCI crew over the last few months, you may not have need for a(nother) fairly uneventable base. Her event tally outside of her debut month stands at two, so you'll be looking for a second unanticipated mega event to ensure her some meaningful shuttle runs. The two highlights are a useful skill set to bolster her somewhat average voyage power and compliment the Q/Scoundrel mega crew Qod. And strong arena EV at six seconds which, like her time on screen, you may wish lasted a bit longer.
