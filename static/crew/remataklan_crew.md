So that Dominion faction have at honored status...oh wait what, they are hostile. Oh boy. You are going to need a fair few Jem'Hadar weapons to get him immortalised. He has a #8 SEC base stat with a reasonable proficiency bonus but, like I've said many times in this document, SEC/CMD is incredibly common and although Third can work a sunday cadet mission there are many other options to consider before putting in the work on him. No extra collection bonus and a poor ship ability means that you can safely put him in the unneeded pile until you want to get the Rare collection completed.
