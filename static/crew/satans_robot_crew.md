The last time I bet against Robot's event prowess, he whipped out his #1 Hologram ENG and beat me over the head with it for four straight weeks. For those of you who want to take him, I'll just say there's no way we get a Villain mega event, absolutely not! His non-bonus ENG work is on shaky ground with mega crew Ru'afo and Etana Jol ahead of him, but on voyages he can still pitch in an uncommon skill set and his vanity collection spot is irreplaceable.
