No point in burying the lede; she's got a big ol' base. Besting former #2 powerhouse and variant Surgeon Pulaski, this crew shaves away at Culber's lead over the pack and offers great standalone shuttle value whether she's bonus or not. Shared by only two other legendaries, Pulaski's skill set is quite useful as well. Beyond each of her skill pairings being rare and valuable for voyages, she's also one of just six MED primaries in the top 100 voyagers. This sort of MED power does not come around too frequently and though it's a shame to see it tied to an event corpse, she's still strong enough to catch weekend work while pitching in impressive voyage credentials.
