A pretty lackluster engineer. He sports a significant ENG base with a rather uncommon CMD modifier, but not at the strength that would make him useful for many voyages. His Innovator collection bonus means you probably won't kick him out straight away but there are plenty of engineers with better stats that can put in more daily work.
