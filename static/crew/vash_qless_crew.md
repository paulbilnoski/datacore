[_Forces beyond our understanding_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-Esh4W3dfI) have selected another legendary Vash variant to kick off the upcoming Scoundrel/Q mega. Smoke 'em if you got 'em, because despite Vash variants having twice as many events as Scotty (...), her traits don't support much future event work outside of perhaps [_Explorer_](https://old.reddit.com/r/StarTrekTimelines/comments/ayv3ll/mega_event_survey/). Quite unremarkable in several areas, you'll be looking primarily at her top ten SCI base, a skill that has been offered in abundance recently, and voyages.

For voyage runs, her SCI/DIP is a blessing and a curse. You won't even need to scroll down the list of top voyagers to find a handful of crew with that skill combo meaning that getting to ten hours is quite achievable and she may help you build strength on strength, but she's not near the top of any metrics in that regard. If you're a fan of Jean-Luc's sassy foil, this Vash will perform alright as Surak-lite for voyages and perhaps catch a few weeks of event work, but the card is just not nearly as titillating as Q(uark)'s on-screen partner in crime.
