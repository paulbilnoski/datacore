Look, sweetheart, you're gunna want this fella. Maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow. But soon...and for the rest of your life. Only a few crew can unlock a particular [_SEC/Investigator node_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Rabid_Fans) and one of the more popular options, Detective Data, is very expensive to equip. Sadly, that covers the bulk of his usefulness. He's recently found a home in a vanity collection, but his voyage numbers and skill set are not helpful, nor is what he brings to the gauntlet and arena. While his event count is a nice perk, there are so many Picard versions floating around that his primary, SEC, comes in 7th among variants.

> With poor stats and a billion variants ahead of him for events, a lot of Dix's value is tied to his Investigator/SEC node unlock. Two recent event crew including recurring mega Thrax are capable of reproducing that particular perk, leaving his vanity collection as perhaps his most desirable attribute.
