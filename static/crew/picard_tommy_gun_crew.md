Look, sweetheart, you're gunna want this fella. Maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow. But soon...and for the rest of your life. Only a few crew can unlock a particular [_SEC/Investigator node_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Rabid_Fans) and if you missed former mega Thrax, then Dix might be your best option. He's recently found a home in a vanity collection, but his voyage numbers and skill set are not helpful, nor is what he brings to the gauntlet and arena. While his event count is a nice perk, there are so many Picard versions floating around that his primary, SEC, comes in 7th among variants. His impending television show should help out his weekend chances to sneak onto a fourth or requisition shuttle.
