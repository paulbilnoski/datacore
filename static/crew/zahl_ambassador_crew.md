For a character whose contribution to the Trekverse boils down to "Go, racers, go!", it's only fitting that his card is equally dull. Most of us need an average DIP shuttler like we need another hole in our head, but if you find yourself without having the Diplomat collection complete, then the Ambassador is at least worth an hour of tap tap taparoo to acquire. Take him for the +1 and some niche arena work, but if you're expecting more, I'm afraid that, well...That's Zahl, Folks!
