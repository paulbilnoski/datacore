The most interesting aspect of this crew is the missing period from the abbreviation of Doctor. Which she is...and pitches in for the Physician collection. But Crusher is simply not an event player so an above average MED base may languish without a use for long periods. Her uncommon MED/CMD stack belies a gross voyage score and in combination with theoretical event potential makes her an okay target for players who haven't finished her collection, but don't expect as much utility as some MED crew can offer.
