It's odd to see a version of Seven with such good bases. The only variant with a base over 1k has two of them, in fact. She's clearly _the _Seven to own for events, but the fact that she was a global gift does muddy the water a bit. Her stealth addition to the portal so soon after her release more or less eliminates citations as an option to help leverage her into an advantage in Borg/Seven events. She's good-not-great in other areas of the game and if your roster is weak enough that she would be an upgrade for you anywhere but events, then you'll probably want to focus your resources on other crew first.
