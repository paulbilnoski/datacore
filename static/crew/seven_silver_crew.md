It's odd to see a version of Seven with such good bases. The only variant with a base over 1k has two of them, in fact. She's clearly better than the older Sevens for events, but the fact that she was a global gift does muddy the water a bit. If you're looking to add stars to her, keep in mind that the competition probably also has Silvers, whose 1/5 ENG is actually better than a fully fused [_gauntlet Seven_](https://stt.wiki/wiki/Seven_of_Nine). She's okay-not-good in other areas of the game and if your roster is weak enough that she would be an upgrade for you anywhere but events, then you may want to focus your resources on other crew first.
