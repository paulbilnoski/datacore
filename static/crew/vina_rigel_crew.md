In an endeavour to get Captain Pike's [_torpedo to launch_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMoXON7k--c), Rigel Vina is another bit of Talosian trickery. But not even Roddenberry's legendary soft lens could convince us to blow our (dilithium) load on this crew. Without any interesting gauntlet/arena/collection considerations that normally save other two-skillers, Vina's packing only four traits with bloated crew pools which may put weekend relevance out of reach. Even if her dress sense were to convince DB to count her for Lwaxana events, this is not a crew who can justify her spot on your roster.
