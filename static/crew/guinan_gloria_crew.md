Gloria _from Cleveland_ is one of the most fascinating crew who never gets talked about. There's nothing about her that screams powerhouse, but she'll perform well in several niche situations. First off, she qualifies for the dreaded "Guinan" gauntlet where "El-Aurian" and requisite traits gives her (and only few others) 45-65% crit. With a CMD skill that Bartender Guinan lacks, she should be able to produce even against normally superior crew. On ships, she provides a beefy +11 attack (trigger required) with great passive accuracy quick enough to supplement almost any crew. Her vanity collection spot is unique, if not beneficial to gameplay, and with a chunk of CMD/MED for voyages, she'll likely perform beyond the raw total for a couple different combos.
