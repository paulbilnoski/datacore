Perhaps the absolute epitome of event crew. With sub-standard voyage numbers and no Gauntlet use, you'll find her slipping from daily utility as you gather more potent and multi-faceted SCI crew who can match her 800+ base, but with no less than five separate event features - more than any other crew - and a skyhigh Dax event count on top of that, you're going to be unfreezing her practically every other weekend. Arena Evasion earns her niche use elsewhere, but this Dax is a weekend warrior, first and foremost.

> The first crew to reach five event features. Add on two Dax events in three months to open 2019 and her weekend duty doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon.
