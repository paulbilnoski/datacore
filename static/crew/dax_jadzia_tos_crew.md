Beehive Dax is the absolute epitome of event crew. With sub-standard voyage numbers and no Gauntlet use, you'll find her slipping from daily utility as you gather more potent and multi-faceted SCI crew who can match her 800+ base. But with no fewer than _five_ separate event features - more than any other crew - and a skyhigh Dax event count on top of that, you're going to be unfreezing her practically every other weekend. Arena Evasion earns her niche use elsewhere, but this Dax is a weekend warrior, first and foremost.
