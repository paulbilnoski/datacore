[_The Great Material Continuum_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxHhCh9zA3I) giveth and taketh away. 2018 was great to Quark, giving him six events in the calendar year, but since then his name hasn't been called. Will he get a little love down the line in a costumed or romantic mega? Sure. But until then, he's merely a poor-for-legendary, good-for-super-rare type of shuttle pilot. Although Quark doesn't own a top 15 gauntlet pair, he shows up with 65% crit on occasion which can make even average gauntleteers relevant.
