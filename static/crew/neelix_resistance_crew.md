Notably ahead of a few 3-skillers for voyages and owner of double 1k bases to possibly earn him some shuttle work, but a DIP/SEC 2-skiller will more realistically eat a crew slot until his event number is called. Double digit traits for possible event work become less impressive when they include Mylean and Talaxian, but he's still likely to catch some mega work down the line. Watch his episode and see if you can figure out how running away and getting shot in the back earns him 1054 SEC.
