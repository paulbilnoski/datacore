Miles chugged along in 2018 capitalizing on a half dozen event opportunities while proving once again that Britain's finest is one of STT's finest. Two 1k bases with a half dozen O'Brien events is all a non-Disco crew can hope for, but the Pilot mega triggering an extra month of bonuses is a good reminder to consider a crew's traits when judging them. He's a voyage stalwart even as ENG/CMD's options grow, and perhaps most impressively, a member of two fairly exclusive collections. Considering the number of bad options among the legendaries required to complete Jury Rigger, most paths to completion will run through RAF Miles.
