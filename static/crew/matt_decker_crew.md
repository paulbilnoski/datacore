TOS collectors, eat your hearts out. The name of the Commodore's theme pack, 'Sad Stories', sums up this character and crew rather well. Beyond the above ranks, Matt owns a top five voyage CMD, a peculiarly low SECondary base, and wields a 400% arena torpedo at eight seconds which is both handy and increasingly easy to find elsewhere. This stock standard power creep crew is stat-relevant enough to be useful on most rosters today, but history tells us that without events or any unique/powerhouse elements, he won't age as well as some. If you invest in him, especially considering the odds of the pack he comes from, make it for sentimental reasons and enjoy his daily use until he's eaten by a giant tinfoil space worm.
