As with a lot of voyage-only crew, Lucien is someone to keep on side mostly for the cool factor. Although he brings handy voyage numbers to the table, by the time you star him up, you won't need them. He clearly lacks in all other areas except the possibility of a couple trait megas where he'll probably be flying your requisition shuttles. You know what they say - the Devil finds work for idle hands.
