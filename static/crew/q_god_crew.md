DB is mad libbing their way through 2019 with [Top 10 base] and [Voyage rank 20-40], but for a free crew with Qod's skill set, who can complain? Yes, you're citing him, or at least pulling some recap packs at the end of the month. Although his use is narrower than some, he does bring home the bacon in a big way for base/events and voyages. Sharing a legendary skill order with only Mobile Doc who sits a cool 200 ranks below him (~10.5% power), he's a top three MED voyager and in many circumstances should be giving the boot to 2-skillers Culber or Pulaski if you're using them in that capacity.

Similarly for base, Qod continues the march of crew climbing the ladder to try and reach the #1 overall MED leader Culber. If you've never had the chance to snag the Disco Demigod, Qod should soften the blow and approximate Culber's fused power in most situations. He's the first (but not last) Q continuum crew with the MED skill and will monopolize their events' shuttles as well as former MED megas for non-bonus (or Costumed) situations without crowding them out of voyages. He's a row of zeroes elsewhere, but big base power, an average event clip, and great voyage compliment makes it worth paying for his last star on any roster.
