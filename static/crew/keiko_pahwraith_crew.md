Her outrageous CMD base is as impressive and baffling now as the day she was released. While a #1 base is a significant attribute, if you have someone like the Ã¼ber popular #2 FO Burnham, Keiko may be somewhat redundant for non-bonus event work. Nevertheless, that huge base and passable voyage numbers put her among the better non-event crew and allow her to contribute even with a common skill set. Bad peripheral attributes (arena/collections/gauntlet/skill set/event count) hamstring her flexibility, if not her usability.
