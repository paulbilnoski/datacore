In somewhat of a rare move from DB we have a main cast card that actually can keep up with all the ensigns! The #1 ENG crew in the 3* leagues but he's not just a one skill wonder! His secondary skills mean he's got some voyage legs too. His ship ability is not too shabby either, granting some useful evasion bonuses and shield repair which gives him some use in Arena and Skirmish events. Finally he's a Jury Rigger, the notoriously hard to fill collection which is always better for having easy crew to fill it with.
